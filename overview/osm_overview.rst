OpenStreetMap
=============

Tools for mapping the world
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`OpenStreetMap <http://www.openstreetmap.org>`_ is a project aimed
squarely at creating and providing free geographic data such as street
maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most maps
you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their
use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive or
unexpected ways.

Five programs have been included: JOSM, Merkaartor, Gosmore, Osmarender, and
Osm2pgsql. In addition recent sample data for the host city and a number
of JOSM plugins have been included and the Gpsd service for interfacing
with real-time GPS.
