*********************
OSGeo-Live Quickstart
*********************

This Quick Start describes how to start the OSGeo-Live DVD.

System Requirements
-------------------

* RAM: 512 Meg, preferably 1 Gig.
* CPU: 1 GHz i686 or compatible (Intel/AMD)
* Hard Disk: 

 * None required if running directly from the DVD 
 * 5 Gig if you wish to install the operating system. 

* Mouse: a 3-button mouse is useful, especially for Mac trackpad users. 

Run:
----

  Source an OSGeo-Live DVD, ISO available from: http://download.osgeo.org/livedvd 
  Put the DVD into your computer's CD drive, then reboot your computer.

  If your computer is set to boot from CD (as is often the case) you should boot up into an Xubuntu system, with Geospatial applications installed. Otherwise you'll have to adjust the BIOS boot settings or press the boot menu button just after powering-up.
