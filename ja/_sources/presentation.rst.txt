            ================== ============== =============== ================



        .. rv_note::
            Let's start by reviewing Desktop GIS applications,
            where we find the heavy lifting applications.
            These applications cover the traditional GIS uses cases of viewing,
            editing and analysing geospatial data.
    

    .. revealjs:: QGIS
        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/qgis/qgis_screenshot.png
            :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            Quantum GIS, or QGIS, is a very popular user-friendly GIS client which allows you to visualize, manage, edit, analyse data, and compose printable maps. It supports numerous vector, raster and database formats, and boasts many free toolboxes, including a user-friendly interface to many of the advanced GRASS analysis modules.
        




    .. revealjs:: GRASS GIS
        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/grass/grass_screenshot.png
            :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            GRASS GIS provides powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing. It includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.
            It includes over 400 built-in analysis modules and 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes.
            With over 30 years of continuous development, GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available. It is capable of very powerful analysis, but may not be as simple to get started with as other offerings with more of a geodata viewer focus. Many Open Source projects make use of GRASS's algorithms.




    .. revealjs:: gvSIG Desktop
        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/gvsig/gvsig_screenshot.png
            :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            In 2003, the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure in Valencia, Spain, started migrating all their systems to Open Source Software. Part of this migration involved the development of gvSIG to replace ESRI desktop applications in use.
            gvSIG is a desktop GIS application designed for capturing, storing, handling, analysing and deploying any kind of referenced geographic information in order to solve complex management and planning problems.
            gvSIG is available in over 20 languages, and has a very strong following amongst Spanish speakers.

            Note 
            uDig is a java-based spatial data viewer and editor, which is based upon the geotools library and powerful Eclipse development environment, making uDig a common choice for developers wishing to integrate mapping into java based applications.
        




    .. revealjs:: OpenJUMP GIS
        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/openjump/openjump_screenshot.png
            :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            OpenJUMP is a spin-off from the original JUMP project, which was Open Source but didn't accept improvements and updates from the community. This resulted in over 10 forks of the original code base. OpenJUMP provided a merging back together of many of these forks.
            OpenJUMP is an easy to use and powerful deskstop GIS that enables users to edit, analyse, and display geographic data. It is particularly good at conflation, which involves aligning a feature which is shown in different locations on two different map layers.

            Note 
            GDAL and OGR are best known as the vector and raster Geographic Data Abstraction Libraries used by many open source and proprietary applications. However, the functions are also accessible as command line utilities to translate and process a wide range of vector and raster geospatial data formats.

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            GeoTools is used by most Java based Geospatial applications. It provides standards based geospatial data structures, connectors to numerous data stores, data manipulation and rendering functionality.

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            GEOS provides a port of JTS to C and C++. There are also bindings to Python and other languages.

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            PROJ is a library that provides methods to transform between different coordinate reference systems. A geographic coordinate reference systems allows all points on the earth to be described as a set of coordinates (such as latitude, longitude and elevation). Different systems are used to represent the 3 dimensional earth on a flat, 2 dimensional map..

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            JTS, or Java Topology Suite, is a java library of spatial predicates and functions for processing geometries. It is used by most java based open source geospatial applications. It provides a complete, consistent, and robust implementation of fundamental algorithms for processing linear geometry on the 2-dimensional Cartesian plane.
