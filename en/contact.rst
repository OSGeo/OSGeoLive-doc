================================================================================

This Live GIS disc and virtual-machine has been put together by members
of the OSGeo community to showcase their favourite Free and Open Source
(FOSS) geospatial software. We've included a number of non-OSGeo software
packages, GIS focused and otherwise, which we hope you will find to be as
useful as we do. The OSGeo Foundation does not recommend or guarantee any
associated software, projects, or companies found within.
