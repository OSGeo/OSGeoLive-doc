Project Jupyter was born out of the IPython Project in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages.

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

Using the Jupyter Notebook, you can author engaging documents that combine live-code with narrative text, equations, images, video, and visualizations. By encoding a complete and reproducible record of a computation, the documents can be shared with others on GitHub, Dropbox, and the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
