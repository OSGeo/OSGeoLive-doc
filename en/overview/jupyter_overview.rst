The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

Using the Jupyter Notebook, you can author engaging documents that combine live-code with narrative text, equations, images, video, and visualizations. By encoding a complete and reproducible record of a computation, the documents can be shared with others on GitHub, Dropbox, and the `Jupyter Notebook Viewer 
<https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`_.


Core Features
================================================================================

* Create Jupyter notebooks which contain:

    * Marked up text (with headings, styles, paragraphs, etc)
    * Formulas, mathematics, plots, maps, ...
    * Ability to import external libraries to add extra functionality,
    * Ability to incorporate code from multiple programming languages, including python, R, Julia, Bash and many more.

* The jupter notebook user on the OSGeoLive will have access a wide range of geospatial functions like:

    * Numpy, SciPy Matplotlib, IRIS, Cartopy, gdal, Geopandas, pyshp, Fiona, netCDF4, PostgreSQL, psycopg2, R, rpy2, and more.
