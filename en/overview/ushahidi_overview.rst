Ushahidi
================================================================================

Incident Timeline & Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Ushahidi <http://www.ushahidi.com/>`_ Engine is a free and open source
platform that allows anyone to gather distributed data via SMS, email or 
web and visualize it on a map or a timeline. Ushahidi's goal is to create tools for 
democratizing information, increasing transparency and lowering the barriers 
for individuals to share their stories.

Ushahidi, which means "testimony" in Swahili, was initially developed to
map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the
beginning of 2008. Ushahidi's roots are in the collaboration of Kenyan
citizen journalists during a time of crisis. The website was used to map
incidents of violence and peace efforts throughout the country based on
reports submitted via the web and mobile phone. This initial deployment of
Ushahidi had 45,000 users in Kenya, and was the catalyst for us realizing
there was a need for a platform based on it, which could be use by others
around the world.
