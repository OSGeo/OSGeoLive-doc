gvSIG Desktop
================================================================================

Desktop GIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

gvSIG_ is a Geographic Information System (GIS) desktop application designed for capturing, storing, handling, analysing and deploying any kind of referenced geographic information in order to solve complex management and planning problems. gvSIG is known for its user-friendly interface and being able to access all common vector and raster formats. It features a wide range of tools for working with geographic information (query, layout creation, geoprocessing, networks, etc.), which turns gvSIG into the ideal tool for users working in the land realm.

gvSIG is known for:

* integrating in the same view both local and remote data through OGC standards.
* being easily extendible, allowing continuous application enhancement, as well as enabling the development of tailor-made solutions.
* being available in over 20 languages (Spanish, English, German, French, Italian,...).
* being available for Windows and Linux (there are also non-oficial Mac OS X versions).
