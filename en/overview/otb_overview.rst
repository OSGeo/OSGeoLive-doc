OTB
================================================================================

Image Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ORFEO Toolbox Library (OTB) is a high performance image processing
library. It is primarily used for processing remote sensing images
such as those gathered by radars, satellites and aerial
photography. OTB provides tools for the future optic and radar images
(tridimensional aspects, changes detection, texture analysis, pattern
matching, optic/radar complementarities).

OTB has been funded the French Space Agency (CNES) in the frame of the
Methodological Part of the ORFEO Accompaniement Program and has been
actively developed since 2006. It is based on the established medical
image processing library ITK and is distributed as open source.
