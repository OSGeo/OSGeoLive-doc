R for Spatial Data
================================================================================

Statistical Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

R is a powerful, widely used software environment for statistical
computing and graphics which excels at analyzing and processing
geographic data sets. Geospatial analysis capabilities within R are
available in R packages (modules that extend the capabilities of R)
that provide access to a large number of traditional and state of the
art algorithms, often before they are available in other open source
or proprietary software. R and its packages are able to process point,
line, polygon and grid data. Users can accomplish a broad array of
tasks such as: image classification, statistical analysis to infer
spatial relationships and patterns of features, and others listed in
the core features below. The functions available via R complement and
advance capabilities found in GIS and image processing software.

The core R interface is a command line window which provides excellent
flexibility and control but tends to lengthen the time required to
become a proficient user when compared to software with a graphical
user interface (GUI). Fortunately R is well documented on the web site
which eases the learning process. Scripts are often used to automate
processing steps and there are projects that are developing open
source GUIs for R (http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=guis:guis).

R is an implementation of the S programming language and there is
significant compatibility between R and legacy S and S-Plus code as
well as between R and the modern commercial version of S, TIBCO
Spotfire S+. This makes it possible to convert different
versions of S code to run on R without major code modifications.
