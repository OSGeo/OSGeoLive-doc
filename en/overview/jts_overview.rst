JTS Topology Suite (JTS)
================================================================================

JTS is an open source library of spatial predicates and functions for
processing geometries.  It provides a complete, consistent, and robust implementation of fundamental
algorithms for processing linear geometry on the 2-dimensional Cartesian plane.

JTS includes the "JTS Test Builder" which allows users to
run tests and experiment with geometry through an interactive desktop interface.
JTS stability is ensured through an extensive test suite.

JTS is used by most java based Open Source geospatial applications, and
:doc:`geos_overview`, which is a C++ port of JTS, is used by most
C based applications.  Additional ports are available for C# and JavaScript.
