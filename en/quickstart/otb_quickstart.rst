********************************************************************************
OTB Quickstart 
********************************************************************************

ORFEO Toolbox library (OTB) is a high performance library for image processing targeted on remote sensing.

This Quick Start describes how to:

  * Get metadata informations from an image
  * Perform mathematical operations between image bands
  * Open raster images with the application monteverdi, perform segmentation (mean-shift clustering) and visualize the result
  * Perform supervised classification based on Support Vector Machine algorithm

The OTB applications provide lot's of interesting tools which facilitate the manipulation of images. All these tools are available through:

  * CLI (command line interface) : all applications can be called from a terminal starting with `otbcli_` plus the application name
  * GUI (a standalone graphical user interface in Qt) : the applications can be called from a terminal with the alias `otbgui_` plus the application name. An other option is to use a small launcher (available in the menu -> Geospatial -> Spatial Tools -> OTB Launcher)
  * QGIS plugin : available through the processing framework

Sample data used in this quickstart can be found in :
  * /home/user/data/north_carolina/rast_geotiffs

Display metadata informations in an image 
================================================================================

You can get all the metadata informations contained in an image with the command : `otbcli_ReadImageInfo`
The unique parameter is the Input image file name, for example::

  otbcli_ReadImageInfo -in ortho_2001_t792_1m.tif

Calculator on image bands
================================================================================

The `otbcli_otbBandMath` provides an efficient way to perform mathematical operation on image bands.
The syntax is quite simple, for example substrating two bands to study the image differences on the images `lsat7_2002_10.tif` and `lsat7_2002_20.tif`, just use the command::

  otbcli_BandMath -il lsat7_2002_10.tif lsat7_2002_20.tif -out difference.tif -exp "im1b1-im2b1"

The application is able to perform complex mathematical operations over images (threshold, logarithmic rescaling...).
This homebrewed digital calculator is also bundled with custom functions allowing to compute a full expression. For example, as remote sensing images measure physical values, it is possible to extract several indices with physical meaning like the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for the vegetation. With the calculator you're able to compute the NDVI on a multispectral sensors images by doing::

  otbcli_BandMath -il lsat7_2002_30.tif lsat7_2002_40.tif -out ~/ndvi.tif -exp "ndvi(im1b1,im2b1)"

The file `lsat7_2002_30.tif` corresponds to Landsat 7 red channel, `lsat7_2002_40.tif` corresponds to Near Infra-Red.

You can then visualize input images and the result with the command ::

  monteverdi lsat7_2002_30.tif lsat7_2002_40.tif ~/ndvi.tif

Pixel based classification
================================================================================
The classification in the application framework provides a supervised pixel-wise
classification chain based on learning from multiple images, and using one 
specified machine learning method like SVM, Bayes, KNN, Random Forests, Artificial 
Neural Network, and others...(see application help of 
`TrainImagesClassifier` for further details about all the available 
classifiers). 
It supports huge images through streaming and multi-threading. The 
classification chain performs a training step based on the intensities of each 
pixel as features. Please note that all the input images must have the same number 
of bands to be comparable.

To discover this application, you can use the command ::

  otbgui_TrainImagesClassifier


Perform segmentation
================================================================================
The OTB *Segmentation* application allows to produce a raster segmentation
output with different algorithms and to scale up to large raster by producing
vector outputs that you can import in a GIS software.
There are four segmentation methods available in the application:

* Mean-Shift
* Watershed (ITK implementation)
* Connected-Components
* Morphological profiles

You can test the segmentation with these commands:

* Creation of a multichannel Red-Green-Blue-Nir image

::

  otbcli_ConcatenateImages -il lsat7_2002_30.tif lsat7_2002_20.tif lsat7_2002_10.tif lsat7_2002_40.tif -out ~/lsat7_rgbn.tif

* Apply segmentation

::

  otbcli_Segmentation -in ~/lsat7_rgbn.tif -filter meanshift -mode raster -mode.raster.out ~/segmentation.tif

* Generate colors instead of labels

::

  otbcli_ColorMapping -in ~/segmentation.tif -out ~/segmentation_colored.tif -method image -method.image.in ~/lsat7_rgbn.tif


Moreover the application can work in two different modes:

* Raster mode: allows to segment a small image and produces a raster where each
        component of the segmentation is labeled with a unique integer
* Vector mode: segment larger images and produces a vector file where each
        segment of the segmentation is represented by a polygon

OTB includes also a framework to perform tile-wise segmentation of very large
image with theoretical guarantees of getting identical results to those without
tiling called LSMS_.

OTB in QGis
================================================================================

The same set of OTB applications can also be used from the Processing -> Toolbox menu in QGis. The applications are sorted by tag.

Developing with OTB
================================================================================

If you want to use the OTB library and compile your C++ code inside OSGeo-Live,
you will need to install development package **libotb-dev** and **libqt4-dev** .
Also check that **cmake** is installed.
The OTB_DIR location should be found automatically (usually in
*/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/OTB-...*). In your CMake configuration, you should
link the libraries in the variable OTB_LIBRARIES. More information can be found
in the SoftwareGuide.

  The main source of information is the OTB Software Guide. This is a
  comprehensive guide which comprises about 600 pages, detailing the
  steps to install OTB and use it. Most of the classes available are
  heavily illustrated with results from real remote sensing
  processing.
