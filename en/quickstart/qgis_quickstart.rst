QGIS Quickstart 
********************************************************************************

QGIS is a user friendly Desktop GIS client which lets
you visualize, manage, edit, analyse data and compose printable maps.

.. contents:: Contents


Edit QGIS project
================================================================================

Let's start by opening up an existing QGIS project, and turning layers on and
off.


#. Launch QGIS from :menuselection:`Geospatial --> Desktop GIS --> QGIS` and select :menuselection:`Project --> Open` from the menu bar.

     .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/qgis_project_open.png
       :scale: 70 %
       :alt: Open a QGIS project


#. Choose :file:`QGIS-NaturalEarth-Example.qgs` and press :guilabel:`Open`.

   * You should see a world map.

#. Tick the ``ne_10m_populated_places`` check box in the Layers tree.

   * Populated places are now displayed as many green dots:

     .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/qgis.png
        :scale: 70 %
        :alt: Map in QGIS

#. Try dragging layers up and down in the legend and see how that
   affects visibility of the layers below.

#. Have a look at the tools on the tool bar. Try panning, zooming in,
   and zooming back out to full extent again.  Find these tools next
   to the :guilabel:`hand` icon. If the toolbars seem cluttered you
   can drag them around and turn them on and off by right clicking.
   You can also zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, and pan with a
   left-click drag.

Style a layer
================================================================================

Now let's try customising the style of the map.

     .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/qgis_style_set.png
        :scale: 70 %
        :alt: Style setting

#. Zoom in a little on the map, then double click ``ne_10m_rivers_lake_centerlines`` in
   the Layers tree.

#. In the `Layer Properties` dialog on the `Style` tab click on the 
`Color` to select a different color, say yellow.

#. Press :guilabel:`OK`.

   * Notice that rivers are now rendered in your new color.

     .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/qgis_style.png

        :alt: Map in QGIS

Create a new QGIS project
================================================================================

Let's now create a new QGIS project and load our own data.

#. Choose :menuselection:`Project --> New`. You will be asked whether to save the previous project, you can press :guilabel:`Close without Saving`.

#. Click :menuselection:`Layer --> Add Layer--> Add Vector Layer...`.

     .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/qgis_add_layer.png
        :scale: 70
        :alt: Add layer

#. Browse to dataset :file:`/home/user/data/natural_earth2/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp`.

#. Press :guilabel:`Open` then :guilabel:`Open` again.

   * You should see all world countries.

     .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/qgis_countries.png
        :scale: 70
        :alt: Add layer result


Connect to a PostGIS spatial database
================================================================================

Let's now include a layer from a Postgres database.

#. In the layer list on the left, untick the ``ne_10m_admin_0_countries`` visibility
   check box to temporarily hide it.

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/qgis_postgis_connect.png
      :scale: 70 %
      :alt: Connecting to a PostGIS DB

#. Choose :menuselection:`Layer --> Add Layers --> Add PostGIS Layers...`.

   * Both Natural Earth and OpenStreetMap Postgis databases
     are already available; we will be using use the Natural Earth database.
     If you wanted to connect to a different database, you would select
     the :guilabel:`New` button and fill in the database parameters.

#. Select the "Natural Earth" connection and press :guilabel:`Connect`. Then 
click on the Public schema to deploy it:

  * A list of database tables will appear.

#. Select ``ne_10_populated_places`` and click :guilabel:`Add`.

   * For more details about working with PostGIS databases see
     the :doc:`PostGIS Quickstart <postgis_quickstart>`.

#. Zoom in on the United States using the mouse wheel and left-click drag
   to navigate.

#. Right click on ``ne_10m_populated_places`` in the layer list to get a context
   menu, then select :menuselection:`Properties`.

#. Let's represent one of the database attributes in the data as a bubble plot.
   In the middle of the `Style` tab, drag the Transparency
   slider to **50%**. Click on the small button at the right of the size field and select
   :menuselection:`Size scale field`, then choose **scalerank** 
   (it's near to the beginning of the list). Then click :guilabel:`Ok`.

#. You can then click on the query button on the toolbar (cursor arrow with
   a blue "i") and then on the map canvas bubbles to view information about
   the individual cities.

Using the GRASS Toolbox
================================================================================

There have been many plugins written for QGIS which extend QGIS's core
functionality. One of the more powerful is the GRASS plugin, which taps
into the hundreds of geospatial processing modules available
from :doc:`GRASS GIS <../overview/grass_overview>`.

#. Clear the slate with :menuselection:`Project --> New`.

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/qgis_plugin.png
      :scale: 70 %
      :alt: Enable GRASS plugin

#. Choose :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and Install Plugins...`, then scroll down or
   type ``grass`` into the Search box, and select the `GRASS 7` plugin.

   * Notice that a new GRASS icon has been added to the Toolbar, a docked window named "GRASS Tools" has apeared on the right of the map area and a new `GRASS` menu item has been added to the `Plugins` menu.

#. Connect to an existing GRASS workspace with :menuselection:`Plugins --> GRASS --> Open mapset`.

   * The GRASS GIS data base (Gisdbase) has already been set to `/home/user/grassdata` on
     the disc for you.

#. Within the central GRASS data base are a number of sample datasets. We'll
   load the North Carolina location, and the ``user1`` mapset within it. Choose
   the `nc_basic_spm_grass7` Location and `user1` working mapset, then click :guilabel:`Ok`.

#. To add a raster map to the QGIS layer list, navigate from QGIS Browser Panel to Home/grassdata/nc_basic_spm_grass7.

   * In the PERMANENT mapset select the `elevation` map and double click to add to the map.

     .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/qgis_grass_layers.jpg
       :scale: 50 %
       :alt: GRASS GIS layers loaded into QGIS

#. Add another GRASS raster layer, this time the `geology` map from the
   PERMANENT mapset.

   * Double click on the `geology` map in the QGIS Layers list and in
     the Transparency tab set its global transparency to 70%.

#. To add a vector map, select a vector layer from the QGIS Browser, similar to the previous steps.

   * From the PERMANENT mapset select the `roadsmajor` map with a double click.

#. Change the layer order if neccessary (roadsmajor, geology, elevation).

The plugin also gives you access to many of the powerful GRASS analysis
modules and visualization tools:

#. From the top menu select :menuselection:`Plugins --> GRASS --> Open GRASS tools` and
   drag the edge to make the window a bit bigger.

   * A long list of analysis tools will appear. Go to the `Modules Tree` tab and
     select :menuselection:`Region settings --> g.region.multiple.raster`.
     Clicking on it will open a new tab. Select ``elevation`` from the
     menu list and press :guilabel:`Run`. The `elevation` map will
     now have a thin red line around it, indicating the extent of
     GRASS's `computational region` bounds.

#. Back in the `Modules Tree` tab of the `GRASS Tools` window, go down
   to :menuselection:`Raster` and select :menuselection:`Surface Management --> Generate Vector contour lines`.

#. In the new module tab that pops open, select the `elevation` map as the
   input.

#. Add some contour levels (e.g. 20, 40, 60, 80, 100)

#. Select the output layer name (e.g. contour_lines), then click :guilabel:`Run`.

Using the Processing Toolbox
================================================================================

A core plugin for QGIS which opens the door to a large family of
processing tools is the Processing Toolbox (formerly named the SEXTANTE Toolbox).
It acts as a standardized wrapper around a number of other sets to tools.

.. TBD: Cameron's review comments:
  If we are to include Sextante, then we need to describe using one of the
  Sextane features.

#. Choose :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`.

   * A new toolbar will open on the right side of the screen with many
     processing tools to choose from. Take some time and have a look around.

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/qgis_toolbox.png
      :scale: 70 %
      :alt: Processing Toolbox

   * You may need to enable a Processing provider in order to use it.
     The following screenshot shows how to enable GRASS GIS 7 support in
     the processing tools. Be sure to disable GRASS support (i.e., GRASS 6).
     Additionally, switch to the "Advanced Interface" (see lower right corner
     in the screenshot) in order to see the providers:

Importing OpenStreetMap data
================================================================================

.. TBD: Cameron comment
  Need a sentence here introducing what the OpenStreetMap tools provide.

#. Open the LX Terminal Emulator from the main :menuselection:`Accessories` menu.

   * Cut and paste the following commands into the Terminal window to create
     a working copy of the OSM data in the home directory:

     ::
     
       cp data/osm/feature_city_CBD.osm.bz2 .
       bzip2 -d feature_city_CBD.osm.bz2

#. In QGIS, choose :menuselection:`Project --> New`. If you had the
   Processing Toolbox open you might want to close it.


   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/qgis_osm_plugin.png
     :scale: 50 %
     :alt:  The OpenStreetMap plugin

#. Choose :menuselection:`Vector --> OpenStreetMap --> Import topology from XML`.

#. Click on the "..." button next to "Input XML file (.osm)" and select
   the `feature_city_CBD.osm` file you just copied into the home directory.
   The "Output SpatialLite DB file" name will be automatically set. Click
   :guilabel:`Ok` to convert the dataset to SpatiaLite format and create
   a connection to the SpatialLite DB within QGIS.

#. Next we need to extract points, lines, and areas, then add topology to
   each of these three new layers. To do this we need to run the tool three times.
   Select :menuselection:`Vector --> OpenStreetMap --> Export toplogy to SpatiaLite` and
   use the "..." button to select the newly created `feature_city_CBD.osm.db` file.
   The `Output layer name` will be automatically filled in for you depending
   on the `Export type` selected. Click the :guilabel:`Load from DB` button
   to load in the available tags. For the "points" layer tick the `amentity` box;
   for the "polylines" layer tick the `highway` layer; and for
   the "polygon" layer select the `building` layer. You may wish to change
   the `Output layer name` to reflect the feature tags that you've selected.
   When you are ready, press :guilabel:`Ok` to load in the layer. You will
   need to again press the :guilabel:`Load from DB` button after changing
   the export type from points to polylines, and polylines to polygons.

#. Once topology is loaded, you can also refine the SpatiaLite layer by
   querying just certain features from within it.
   Select :menuselection:`Layer --> Add Layer --> Add SpatiaLite Layer...` from the
   menu and from the `Databases` list select `feature_city_CBD@...` and
   then click on :guilabel:`Connect`. Double click on
   the `feature_city_cbd_polylines` table and then double click on "highway"
   to start building your SQL query. Then click on the :guilabel:`=` button,
   then the :guilabel:`All` button, and double click on `motorway` from the
   Values list. Click the :guilabel:`Test` button to verify the result,
   and finally click on :guilabel:`Ok`. Back in the `Add SpatiaLite Table`
   window click :guilabel:`Add` to restrict the rendering to just major
   highways. You can repeat this process with new layers to render different
   road types with different widths and styles.

#. You can now explore this rich dataset. Use the ``i`` information cursor
   button in the QGIS toolbar to query individal map features.

Things to Try
================================================================================

* Try viewing data sources with the `QGIS Data Browser <http://planet.qgis.org/planet/tag/qgis%20browser/>`_ in the :menuselection:`Geospatial --> Databases` menu

* Try publishing your QGIS map to the web using :doc:`QGIS Map Server <../overview/qgis_mapserver_overview>` in the :menuselection:`Geospatial --> Web Services` menu.
