ZOO Project Quickstart 
********************************************************************************

The ZOO-Project provides a developer friendly Web Processing Service (WPS) framework for creating and chaining Web Processing Services.
A WPS provides web access to functions which run spatial algorithms.

This Quick Start describes how to:

  * Apply processes to a WFS from a web browser.
