******************************************

Switching Language
------------------

We have installed many common languages. In order to switch the system you will need to:

   1. Log out
   2. On the user selection screen pick a user.
   3. In the bottom panel you will now see a menu to select a different language.
   4. Select another language and enter the password and continue the login as usual.
   5. Repeat the process if wish to change languages again.

The system menus and many of the applications will now appear in the language choosen. If a specific program continues to display in english there is no translation available currently, please consider volunteering to write a translation. Contact the program of interest directly for more information.

For additional languages see :menuselection:`Application --> System --> Language Support` (Requires an internet connection).

Keyboard Support
----------------
International keyboard support is installed, but you will need to configure the system for your specific keyboard.
