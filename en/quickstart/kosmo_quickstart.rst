Loading layers
================================================================================

Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start out, we're going to load some of the sample data included on the OSGeo-Live DVD:

#. Choose the option :menuselection:`View > Load Dataset...` or push the button with the green plus from the main toolbar

#. In the *Format* combobox, select *Shapefile* (**1**)

#. In the file chooser, select the file :file:`ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp` from the directory :file:`/home/user/data/natural_earth2` (**2**)

#. Press the :guilabel:`Ok` button to load the selected shapefile (**3**)

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_select_shape_file.png
     :scale: 70 %

#. In the layer tree, press the visibility checkbox to make the layer visible, right clicking on the *Working* folder if needed

#. Choose again the option :menuselection:`View > Load Dataset...` or push the button with the green plus from the main toolbar

#. In the *Format* combobox, select *Image file* (**1**)

#. In the file chooser, select the file :file:`HYP_50M_SR_W.tif` from the directory :file:`/home/user/data/natural_earth2/` (**2**)

#. Press the :guilabel:`Ok` button to load the selected image file (**3**)

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_select_raster_file.png
    :scale: 70 %   

#. In the layer tree, press the visibility checkbox to make the layer visible

#. You can see that the layer drawing order is from bottom to top in the layer tree: modify the layer order by dragging them in order to show them properly

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/1024x768/kosmo_load_file_example.jpg
    :scale: 70 %   

.. note::
  The OSGeo-Live DVD contains some file data examples in the following directories:
  
  * :file:`/home/user/data` (shapefiles and raster files)
  * :file:`/usr/local/share/OpenJUMP/sample_data` (shapefiles)
      
  You can try to load more examples from those directories. Remember to select the correct format from the *Format* combobox       

.. tip:: 
  It's possible to add all the images from a directory as an unique layer by selecting the parent directory in the *Load Dataset...* dialog: Kosmo Desktop will load them as a mosaic.


Databases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're going to load a database table as an example:

#. Choose the option :menuselection:`View > Load Dataset...` or push the button with the green plus from the main toolbar

#. In the *Format* combobox, select *Database* (**1**)

#. Fill the fields host, port, database name, user name and password with the values:

   * Host: localhost
     
   * Port: 5432
    
   * Database name: natural_earth2
    
   * User name: user
    
   * Password: user        

#. Press the :guilabel:`Connect` button to load the tables present at the *natural_earth2* database (**2**)

#. Select the checkbox corresponding to the table *ne_10m_populated_places* (**3**)

Basic Styling
================================================================================

In this section we're going to style a layer by range using the country population as styling attribute:

#. Select the layer `ne_10m_admin_0_countries` in the layer tree

#. Right click on it and select the option :menuselection:`Simbology > Change Styles...`

#. Click on the tab `Colour theming`

#. Activate the options *Enable colour theming* (**1**) and *by range* (**2**)

#. Select `pop_est` as *Attribute* (**3**), 11 as *Range count* (**4**) and RYG (Color Brewer) as *Color schema* (**5**)

#. Press the :guilabel:`Ok` button to apply the changes (**6**)

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_basic_style_classification.png

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/1024x768/kosmo_styled_layer_by_range.jpg
     :scale: 70 %
     
     

Advanced Styling
================================================================================

In this section we're going to style a layer with some rules and filters, based on an attribute. The example shows how to create two rules, one for capital populated places and other for the rest of them:

#. Select the layer `ne_10m_populated_places` in the layer tree

#. Right click on it and select the option :menuselection:`Simbology > Advanced Style Editor...`

#. Select the feature type style `ne_10m_populated_places` (**1**) and press the :guilabel:`+` button (**2**) to add a new rule to it 

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_advanced_style_feature_type.png
     :scale: 70 %   
 
#. Select `Point symbolizer` as symbolizer type (**1**) and press the :guilabel:`Ok` button (**2**)

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_advanced_style_symbolizer.png
     :scale: 70 %   

#. Select the new rule in the tree (**1**) and edit its properties: set **capital_rule** as `Name` (**2**), **Capitals** as `Title` (**3**),activate its filter (**4**) and edit it (**5**)

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_advanced_style_capital_rule.png
     :scale: 70 %   

#. Select **featurecla** as `Field` (**1**), **Equal to (=)** as `Operator` (**2**) and press the :guilabel:`...` button (**3**) to select an attribute value

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_advanced_style_filter.png
     :scale: 70 %

#. Select the **Admin-0 capital** value (**1**) and press the :guilabel:`Ok` button (**2**)

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_advanced_style_attr_value.png
     :scale: 70 %   

#. Press the :guilabel:`Add` button (**1**) to add the condition to the filter and the :guilabel:`Ok` button (**2**) to set the filter to the rule

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_advanced_style_filter_2.png
     :scale: 70 %   

#. Select the capital rule point symbolizer in the tree (**1**) and edit its properties: set its `Size` to **8** (**2**), its `Well Known Mark` type as **circle** (**3**) and `Color` to light green (**4**)

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_advanced_style_capital_rule_symbolizer.png
     :scale: 70 %   

#. Select the other rule in the tree (**1**) and edit its properties: set **others_rule** as `Name` (**2**), **Others** as `Title` (**3**), mark the `Else filter` checkbox (**4**) and set its maximum scale to **25,000,000** (**5**) (it's necessary to press :guilabel:`ENTER` key after setting the value manually to set it)

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_advanced_style_others_rule.png
     :scale: 70 %   

#. Press the :guilabel:`Ok` button to apply the changes

#. The layer will change its style to reflect the changes:

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/1024x768/kosmo_styled_layer_by_filter.jpg
     :scale: 70 %
          
#. If you make enough zoom in to reach the given scale, both rules would be rendered:

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/1024x768/kosmo_styled_layer_by_filter_2.jpg
     :scale: 70 %

.. note::
  When the map is at full layer scale only capitals are shown. If you zoom in close enough, all the populated places would be shown


Extensions
================================================================================

In this section we're going to activate the Sextante toolbox extension:

#. Choose the option :menuselection:`File > Extension Manager...` or push the button with the :guilabel:`Ext` label from the main toolbar

#. Mark the Sextante extension checkbox (**1**) and press the :guilabel:`Ok` button (**2**)

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_extension_manager.png
     :scale: 70 %   

#. A new Sextante button will be available at the right of the main toolbar

   .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_sextante_extension.png
     :scale: 70 %   

.. tip:: 
  If the `Mark as default` option is selected, the extension would be loaded automatically on next application startup



Things to Try
================================================================================

Here are some additional challenges for you to try:

#. Use the Advanced Style editor to create more complex styles

#. Use the `Query wizard` to select those features that accomplish a given criteria

#. Activate the layer editing mode and use the available tools to edit any of the vectorial layers

#. Generate a set of topology rules for a layer and try to edit it

#. Activate the rest of extensions that form part of the application and see the new tools that are present

#. Configure the application options through the menu option :menuselection:`File > Configuration...`



What Next?
