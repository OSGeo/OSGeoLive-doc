This Quick Start describes some basic steps required to start working with OpenLayers: creating a basic map, adding raster and vector layers and styling features.

OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the 2-clause BSD License (also known as the FreeBSD).

Core Concepts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we start working with OpenLayers it helps to understand OpenLayers core concepts:

**Map**
  The *map* is the core component of OpenLayers. For a *map* to render, a *view*, one or more *layers*, and a target container are needed.

**View**
  The *view* determines how the map is rendered. It is used to set the resolution, the center location, etc. It is like a camera through which we look at the map's content.

**Layers**
 *Layers* can be added to the map in a stacked order. Layers can be either *raster layers* (images), or *vector layers* (points/lines/polygons).

**Source**
  Each layer has a *source*, which knows how to load the layer content.
  In the case of *vector layers*, its source reads vector data
  using a *format* class (for example GeoJSON or KML) and provides the layer
  with a set of *features*.

**Features**
  *Features* represent real world things and can be rendered using different
  *geometries* (like point, line or polygon) using a given *style*, which
  determines its look (line thinkness, fill color, etc).

A basic map
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this step we will create a basic map.

Create a file in e.g. /home/user/ called basic-map.html , and copy the following contentinto the file.

.. code-block:: html

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
      <head>
          <title>Basic map</title>
          <meta charset="UTF-8">
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

          <!-- OpenLayers CSS -->
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://localhost/openlayers/dist/ol.css" type="text/css">

          <!-- Custom styles -->
          <style>
            #map {
              width: 100%;
              height: 500px;
            }
          </style>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Basic map</h1>

          <div id="map"></div>

          <!-- OpenLayers JS-->
          <script src="http://localhost/openlayers/dist/ol-debug.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

          <!-- App code -->
          <script>
            var map = new ol.Map({
              target: 'map',
              layers: [
                new ol.layer.Tile({
                  source: new ol.source.OSM()
                })
              ],
              view: new ol.View({
                center: ol.proj.fromLonLat([2.1833, 41.3833]),
                zoom: 6
              })
            });
          </script>

      </body>
  </html>

**Ex. 1**: Basic code structure

Now try opening basic-map.html from a web browser using File->Open File. You should see the following:

.. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/openlayers-basic-map.png
  :scale: 100 %

Note:

* The code follows the best practice of loading JavaScipt code at the end of the html file.

* An OpenLayers map needs to be attached to a HTML DOM element, so we have created a ``<div>`` element identified by the *map* id.

* Maps are represented by the ``ol.Map`` class. We specify the DOM element to render the map into using the **target** property.

* OpenLayers allows map rendering using two different mechanisms: Canvas and WebGL. The default renderer is *canvas*.

* A map shows data contained within layers, so we have created a tiled layer, represented by the ``ol.layer.Tile`` class, that loads content from the OpenStreetMap project, using the ``ol.source.OSM`` source class.

* Finally, we set the initial position of the *camera* using the ``ol.View`` class, set the initial zoom level and center location.

Adding raster layers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most used raster layers are the tiled layers, provided by the likes of
OpenStreetMap, Stamen, Bing, etc. Tiled layers are represented by the
``ol.layer.Tile`` class and must use a source that knows how to load tiles from
a given provider, like ``ol.source.OSM`` or ``ol.source.Stamen``:

.. code-block:: javascript

  var osm = new ol.layer.Tile({
    source: new ol.source.OSM()
  });

  var stamen = new ol.layer.Tile({
    source: new ol.source.Stamen({
      layer: 'watercolor'
    })
  });

**Ex. 2:** Create raster layers

Layers can be added to the map in two ways:

1. When constructing the ``ol.Map``, using the ``layers`` property:

.. code-block:: javascript

  var map = new ol.Map({
    ...
    layers: [osm, stamen]
    ...
  });

**Ex. 3:** Adding layers on map initialization

2. Adding manually with the ``map.addLayer()`` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

  map.addLayer(osm);
  map.addLayer(stamen);

**Ex. 4:** Adding layers manually

Adding vector layers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vector layers are represented by the ``ol.layer.Vector`` class and must use a
source suitable for reading the vector format, like ``ol.source.GeoJSON``,
``ol.source.KML`` or ``ol.source.TopoJSON``.

.. code-block:: javascript

  var vectorLayer = new ol.layer.Vector({
    source: new ol.source.GeoJSON({
      url: 'url_to_geojson_file'
    })
  });

  // Add Vector layer to map
  map.addLayer(vectorLayer);

**Ex. 5:** Constructing a GeoJSON vector layer

.. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/openlayers-vector.png
  :scale: 100 %

Note, in the previous code we must change the ``url_to_file`` to point to a
valid GeoJSON file placed in our server.
Note that Javascript security will prevent sourcing of datasets from an external URL on a different domain / port (a.k.a. same-origin policy).

Features can also be created manually. In this case we need to create a geometry
that represents the feature:

.. code-block:: javascript

  // Geometries
  var point = new ol.geom.Point(
      ol.proj.transform([3,50], 'EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:3857')
  );
  var circle = new ol.geom.Circle(
      ol.proj.transform([2.1833, 41.3833], 'EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:3857'),
      1000000
  );

  // Features
  var pointFeature = new ol.Feature(point);
  var circleFeature = new ol.Feature(circle);

  // Source
  var vectorSource = new ol.source.Vector({
      projection: 'EPSG:4326'
  });
  vectorSource.addFeatures([pointFeature, circleFeature]);

  // Vector layer
  var vectorLayer = new ol.layer.Vector({
    source: vectorSource
  });

  // Add Vector layer to map
  map.addLayer(vectorLayer);

**Ex. 6:** Adding features by hand

Styling features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features within vector layers can be styled.
The style is determined by a combination of fill, stroke, text  and image, which are all optional. In addition, a style can be applied to a layer, which determines the style of all contained features, or to an individual feature.

A style is represented by the ``ol.style.Style`` class which has properties to set the ``fill``, ``stroke``, ``text`` and ``image`` to be applied. The next example shows the World's administrative limits dataset styled to use a green fill and stroke:

.. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/openlayers-styling.png
  :scale: 100 %

.. code-block:: javascript

  var limitsLayer = new ol.layer.Vector({
    source: new ol.source.Vector({
      url: 'data/world_limits.json',
      format: new ol.format.TopoJSON(),
      projection: 'EPSG:3857'
    }),
    style: new ol.style.Style({
      fill: new ol.style.Fill({
        color: 'rgba(55, 155, 55, 0.3)'
      }),
      stroke: new ol.style.Stroke({
        color: 'rgba(55, 155, 55, 0.8)',
        width: 1
      }),
      image: new ol.style.Circle({
        radius: 7,
        fill: new ol.style.Fill({
          color: 'rgba(55, 155, 55, 0.5)',
        })
      })
    })
  });

**Ex. 7:** Styling features

In the code, we have loaded a TopoJSON file and styled it through the ``style`` property.
We have set a ``fill`` and ``stroke``, required for lines and polygons, and an
``image`` (in this case a circle) used for point features.

Working with events
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the components, like map, layers or controls, trigger events to notify changes. For example we can be notified each time the mouse is moved over the map, or when a feature is added to a vector layer, etc.

Events can be easily registered on an object with the ``on()`` method and unregistered with ``un()``.

The following code registers an event on a map instance, and will be notified each time the pointer is moved. Within the callback function we obtain the pointer coordinates and print in the browser console in two different projections.

.. code-block:: javascript

  map.on('pointermove', function(event) {
    var coord3857 = event.coordinate;
    var coord4326 = ol.proj.transform(coord3857, 'EPSG:3857', 'EPSG:4326');

    console.log(coord3857, coord4326);
  });

**Ex. 8:** Printing pointer position.

What's Next?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes the quickest way to work out how OpenLayers works is to look at examples
and their source code. You can find more OpenLayers information here:

* `API Docs <../../openlayers/apidoc/>`_

* `Examples <../../openlayers/examples/>`_

* `OpenLayers.org Website <http://openlayers.org/>`_
