Geomajas itself is an application framework allowing you to build very diverse and advanced web GIS solutions.

On this OSGeo Live DVD we have included a ready-to-use Geomajas Application. This application features a map, navigation controllers, several data layers, a ribbon toolbar with GIS tools and the Layer Tree.
