********************************************************************************
GeoServer Quickstart 
********************************************************************************

GeoServer is a java application for serving maps (and data) for other
clients to draw.

This Quick Start describes how to:

  * add a vector and raster data source to GeoServer
  * apply color to map features using styling
  * test the layers in a simple web map
  * learn about clients that can display your maps
  * add a layer from a NetCDF file

Start |GS|
================================================================================

#. Select the |osgeolive-appmenupath-geoserver| in the menu.
#. The application will take a few moments to start up and will open a web page at http://localhost:8082/geoserver/web

First Views
================================================================================

When you first open the |GS| page you will see the screen above, first you need to log in using the username **admin** and password **geoserver**. You will now see the *admin page*.

.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-welcome.png
    :scale: 70 %

Select the **Layer Preview** link at the top of the *Data* section in the left hand menu to see a preview of the layers that are loaded on the server.

    :scale: 70 %

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the **OpenLayers** link in the **tiger-ny** row, this will open a new window with a preview of some of the sample data. 

.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-preview.png
    :scale: 70 %
    
You can zoom in to the map in three ways:

        * by clicking on the zoom bar on the left, the higher you click on it the more zoomed in you will see.

        * by using the mouse scroll wheel (if you have one), scrolling up will zoom in and down will zoom out.

        * by dragging a box on the map while holding down the :kbd:`shift key` - this will zoom in to the box selected (or as near as will fit in the screen).

Experiment with this view and look at some of the other previews.  Once you are comfortable viewing existing data you can move on to adding some new data.

Loading Data
================================================================================

.. HB comment: is the following still true? 6.5rc2 worked for me from a DVD+R

.. note::
    You will not be able to carry out the following steps if you are
    running with a **read only** file system (such as the DVD). You
    will either need to run in a Virtual Machine, or from a USB, or install
    OSGeo-Live (or just GeoServer) onto your hard drive.

In this example we are going to use the :doc:`Natural Earth data set <../overview/naturalearth_overview>`
that is included on OSGeo-Live (:file:`/usr/local/share/data/natural_earth2/`).

We need to create a Store for our data. From the |GS| admin page go
to :guilabel:`Stores` and then click on :guilabel:`Add new Store`. You
will see this page:

.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-newstore.png
    :scale: 70 %
    :align: center
    :alt: The New Store page

Select the :guilabel:`Directory of spatial files`, you will see the following: 

.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-new-vector.png
    :scale: 70 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Filling in the New Store page

Type in a name for the Data Store - I used *Natural Earth* and fill in
the URL to the data set - in this case :file:`/usr/local/share/data/natural_earth2/`. 
You can use the browse button to find the directory if your data is somewhere else. Press :guilabel:`save`.

.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-naturalearth.png
    :align: center 
    :scale: 70 %
    :alt: The Natural Earth Datastore

Press :guilabel:`publish` next to one of the layers to finish up adding
the data. This will take you to the *Layers* page:

.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-publish.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 70 %
    :alt: The layer publishing page

As you scroll down the page you will see that |GS| has filled in many of
the fields for you. When you reach :guilabel:`Coordinate Reference System`
you will notice that under *Native SRS* that it says UNKNOWN 
you will need to fill in the next box (*declared SRS*) to make sure |GS|
knows where the data is. For the time being trust me and type epsg:4326 in
the box, if you don't trust me then go to `http://prj2epsg.org/search <http://prj2epsg.org/search>`_ and
paste in the string you see if you click on the link next to "UNKNOWN".
Then click on :guilabel:`Compute from data` and :guilabel:`Compute from
native bounds` to fill in the Bounding Boxes. Finally hit :guilabel:`save`
and you have published your first layer.

.. note::
    Don't worry if the layer preview doesn't look
    very good as it is using the default style. In the next section
    we will look at producing a nicer style.

You can follow the same step with the other layers in the directory by using the :guilabel:`Add a new resource` button on the layers page. Just select the natural earth store from the drop down box to get back to the store's page.

Styling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To style a data set into a map layer |GS| uses an OGC standard called
:doc:`Styled Layer Descriptors (SLD) <../standards/sld_overview>`. These 
are represented as XML files which describe the rules that are used to 
apply various symbolizers to the data.

To get started I styled the Land and Ocean datasets. 
You can create SLD files using a simple text editor, but
sometimes a graphical editor is better. There are several options here
but I like to use |UG| as it allows me to open the shapefiles directly 
and apply simple styles using a GUI, but also provides a simple editor 
to modify the XML if I need to. 

Using |UG| to create simple styles
``````````````````````````````````

.. note::

   For more details on how to use |UG| see the :doc:`uDig Quickstart <../quickstart/udig_quickstart>`

Once I opened |UG| up and added the shapefiles (using the
add data button in the top left hand corner). I dragged the ne_10m_land
and ne_10m_ocean tables into the map window. |UG| automatically applies
a style (so you can see the data).

.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-udig_startup.png

   :alt: Default Styling in uDig

Now obviously an orange ocean will not work (even if I could live
with the green land). So in the :ref:`Layer list <Layer_list>` select the style
button (it looks like an artist's palette). 

.. _Layer_list:
.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-layer-chooser.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %
   :alt: The Layer list window

This will open the :ref:`Style Pane <Style_Pane>` - in the simple window I can easily
select a nice blue for the oceans by clicking on the colored box on
the fill tab and choosing from the color picker it produces. I also
increased the opacity of the fill to 100% to make the color look
better. I picked the same blue for the border color so it would match.

.. _Style_Pane:
.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-style-pane.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %
   :alt: The Style Pane 

Once I was done I clicked ``OK`` and |UG| showed me the
changes. 


.. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-blue-ocean.png

   :scale: 70 %
   :alt: Blue Oceans

Finally I prefer a more understated land color than green so
I repeated the steps above to change the color of the land layer.
None of the default colors seemed right to me so I went into the
``define custom colors`` section to create one I liked.

This gives me a nice looking basic world map

Adding the Style to |GS|
````````````````````````

Now we need to transfer these styles to |GS| - on the style window
there is an export button which allows me to save the SLD file that
defines my style. Once I've saved the two styles I can go to the |GS|
admin page again and select ``Styles`` (at the bottom of the ``Data``
section). Then I select the ``Add New Style`` link, at the bottom of
that page is a file upload box and a browse button. Clicking this
allows me to hunt around on my hard drive to find the files I just
saved. Once I've found one I want, I click the upload link (next to the browse
button) and a copy of my file appears in the editor. If you click on the
validate button the highlighted lines will give you an error but you can
safely ignore the error (or delete those lines as they don't do anything).
When you are ready press the :guilabel:`Submit` at the bottom of the page.

   :alt: Adding a Style to GeoServer


Adding the Style to the Layer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Click on the :guilabel:`Layers` link in the Menu on the left of the
|GS| window. Click on the layer (e.g. *ne_10m_land*), then select the 
:guilabel:`Publishing` tab and change the :guilabel:`Default Style`
box to the name of the style you uploaded in the previous section.
Now click :guilabel:`Save` and go to the Layer Preview page to check that it looks good.

.. note:: There are example style files for all of the example Natural Earth layers in :file:`/usr/local/share/geoserver`. 

.. TBD (needs more memory)
    Adding a Raster
    ===============

    In the Natural Earth folder is a folder :file:`HYP_50M_SR_W` which
    contains a raster image. You can serve this up in |GS| directly by
    going to the stores page and selecting :menuselection:`New Stores --> World Image` 
    and type
    :file:`/home/user/data/natural_earth2/HYP_50M_SR_W.tif`
    into the :guilabel:`URL` box.

    .. image:: /images/screenshots/800x600/geoserver-raster.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 70 %
        :alt: Adding a Raster

    The click :guilabel:`Save` this will take you to the *New Layers
    Chooser* then click publish and :guilabel:`Save` to finish adding the
    raster. If you go to the Layers Preview page you
    can see the new image. 


Clients for WMS layers
================================================================================

A large variety of clients exist to make use of the :doc:`WMS <../standards/wms_overview>` layers you are serving
from |GS|. This is a list of just some of them 

    * :doc:`uDig <../overview/udig_overview>`

    * :doc:`OpenLayers <../overview/openlayers_overview>`

    * :doc:`MapBender <../overview/mapbender_overview>`

NetCDF
================================================================================

The GeoServer NetCDF plugin allows the publication of rasters from NetCDF files.

Configure a NetCDF store
------------------------

After running "Start GeoServer", login as the administrator, click on "Add stores" then "NetCDF". Enter a value for Data Source Name (this example uses "netcdf") and a NetCDF URL. You can use the URL::

    file:///usr/local/lib/geoserver/doc/user/_downloads/polyphemus_20120401.nc

This sample file from the GeoServer documentation is included with OSGeo Live. Press "Save", "Publish" the "O3" layer, then scroll down to the bottom of the "Data" tab and press "Save" again.

        :align: center
        :scale: 100 %
        :alt: Adding a NetCDF store

Preview the NetCDF layer
------------------------

Select "Layer Preview" from the menu on the left, scroll down to find the "cite:O3" entry, and click on the "OpenLayers" link to show a preview of the layer. Clicking on points will cause the value of "Ozone_concentration" to be shown in a table at the bottom of the map.

.. note::
    This GeoServer instance has been configured with the ``NETCDF_DATA_DIR`` Java system property to allow the publication of NetCDF files in read-only directories.

What Next?
================================================================================

This is only the first step on the road to using GeoServer. There is
a lot more functionality you can try.
