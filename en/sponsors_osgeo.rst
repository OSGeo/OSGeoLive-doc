The OSGeo Foundation
================================================================================

The `Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) <http://osgeo.org>`_,
is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to support and promote
the collaborative development of open geospatial technologies and data.
The foundation provides financial, organizational and legal support to
the broader open source geospatial community. It serves as an independent
legal entity to which community members can contribute code, funding and
other resources, secure in the knowledge that their contributions will be
maintained for public benefit. OSGeo also serves as an outreach and
advocacy organization for the open source geospatial community, and
provides a common forum and shared infrastructure for improving
cross-project collaboration.

The foundation's projects are all freely available and useable under an
 `OSI-certified open source license. <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/>`_

This Live GIS disc and virtual-machine has been put together by members
of the OSGeo community to showcase their favourite Free and Open Source
(FOSS) geospatial software. We've included a number of non-OSGeo software
packages, GIS focused and otherwise, which we hope you will find to be as
useful as we do. The OSGeo Foundation does not recommend or guarantee any
associated software, projects, or companies found within.

`These programs are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,

MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.`
