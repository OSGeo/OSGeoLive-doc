The OSGeo Foundation
================================================================================

_Empower everyone with open source geospatial_

The `Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) <http://osgeo.org>`__
is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to foster global
adoption of open geospatial technology by being an inclusive software
foundation devoted to an open philosophy and participatory community
driven development.

The foundation provides financial, organizational and legal support to
the broader open source geospatial community. It serves as an independent
legal entity to which community members can contribute code, funding and
other resources, secure in the knowledge that their contributions will be
maintained for public benefit. OSGeo also serves as an outreach and
advocacy organization for the open source geospatial community, and
provides a common forum and shared infrastructure for improving
cross-project collaboration.

The foundation's projects are all freely available and useable under an
`Open Source Initiative <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/>`__
certified open source license.

Foundation outreach and activities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OSGeo is here to help:

* `Local Chapters <http://www.osgeo.org/content/chapters/index.html>`__: Local and regional (and language) groups have been set up around the world to help you get the most out of open source.
* `GeoForAll <http://www.geoforall.org>`_: Education and academic outreach is provided by the GeoForAll initiative consisting of over a hundred labs world wide. This partnership with ICA, ISPRS, UN-GIS and others is actively promoting Open Education and provides a great resource of academic material for education.
* `OSGeo Live <http://live.osgeo.org>`__: A great distribution of open source geospatial software ready for you to try out. OSGeo live is available as either a bootable USB stick or a virtual machine.
* `FOSS4G <http://foss4g.org>`__: Annual international gathering hosted by OSGeo as the *Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial* conference. 
* `Events <http://www.osgeo.org/events>`__: Many regional foss4g events are planned each year, along with hands on code sprints and other activities.

In addition to grass roots advocacy with local chapters and events OSGeo is pleased to work with our partners and `sponsors <http://www.osgeo.org/content/sponsorship/sponsors.html>`__ to promote open source in academia, government and industry.
