Welcome to OSGeo-Live
=====================

`OSGeo-Live <http://live.osgeo.org>`_ is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual
Machine based on `Xubuntu <http://www.xubuntu.org/>`_, that allows you to try a wide variety of open
source geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed
entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated
and passed around.
