              <p>OSGeo-Live provides a production and marketing pipeline, providing value to a whole range of user groups.</p>
              <p>Developers who package and support testing of their applications on OSGeo-Live get their applications marketed at conferences, workshops and on the web.</p>
              <p>Document writers get their documentation reviewed, translated into multiple languages and published.</p>
              <p>Translators are provided with quality source documentation, and a publish through OSGeo web pages.</p>
              <p>Conference organisors welcome presentations which explain the breadth of Geospatial Open Source, often having a VIP present a derivative of the OSGeo-Live during keynote presentations, and adding value to delegates by giving away an OSGeo-Live DVD or USB.</p>
              <p>Geospatial educators and workshop presenters use the stable OGeo-Live Virtual Machine or USB for practical class room settings.</p>
              <p>Which all leads to Architects and Developers discovering, and then incorporating Open Source Geospatial software in their projects.</p>

              <p>OSGeo-Live includes overviews of some of the key OGC standards in simple language so they can be understood by people without a technical background.</p>
              <p>Building Spatial Data Infrastructures using standards, facilitates interoperability between proprietary and open source applications. It facilitates sharing data between agencies. It reduces long term costs associated with data maintenance, and it reduces long term project risk by avoiding dependence upon proprietary formats or products, thus avoiding vendor lock-in.</p>

              <p>GRASS GIS provides powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing. It includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.</p>
              <p>It includes over 400 built-in analysis modules and 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes.</p>
              <p>With over 30 years of continuous development, GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available. It is capable of very powerful analysis, but may not be as simple to get started with as other offerings with more of a geodata viewer focus. Many Open Source projects make use of GRASS's algorithms.</p>

              <p>In 2003, the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure in Valencia, Spain, started migrating all their systems to Open Source Software. Part of this migration involved the development of gvSIG to replace ESRI desktop applications in use.</p>
              <p>gvSIG is a desktop GIS application designed for capturing, storing, handling, analysing and deploying any kind of referenced geographic information in order to solve complex management and planning problems.</p>
              <p>gvSIG is available in over 20 languages, and has a very strong following amongst Spanish speakers.</p>
