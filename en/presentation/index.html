                     <p>OSGeo Live is a self-contained bootable DVD, based on the Lubuntu linux distribution, that is pre-installed and pre-configured with over 50 of the best GeoSpatial Open Source applications along with sample datasets.</p>
                     <p>It contains overview and quickstart documentation for each application, as well as documentation about key OGC spatial standards.</p>
                     <p>The DVD is ideal for handing out at conferences, using in workshops, and trialling a range of Open Source Software.</p>

                     <p>OSGeo-Live helps new users quickly find quality GIS applications from the myriads of options. OSGeo-Live only accepts established open source projects, and users can then verify the application works by running it on OSGeo-Live. This slide shows the OpenHUB metrics page, which shows the community size and activity.</p>

                     <p>OSGeo-Live provides a production and marketing pipeline, providing value to a whole range of user groups.</p>
                     <p>Developers who package and support testing of their applications on OSGeo-Live get their applications marketed at conferences, workshops and on the web.</p>
                     <p>Document writers get their documentation reviewed, translated into multiple languages and published.</p>
                     <p>Translators are provided with quality source documentation, and a publish through OSGeo web pages.</p>
                     <p>Conference organisors welcome presentations which explain the breadth of Geospatial Open Source, often having a VIP present a derivative of the OSGeo-Live during keynote presentations, and adding value to delegates by giving away an OSGeo-Live DVD or USB.</p>
                     <p>Geospatial educators and workshop presenters use the stable OGeo-Live Virtual Machine or USB for practical class room settings.</p>
                     <p>Which all leads to Architects and Developers discovering, and then incorporating Open Source Geospatial software in their projects.</p>

                     <p>Open Source applications have a reputation for excellent standards compliance. Notably, the OGC uses Open Source projects when defining reference implementations for standards.</p>
                     <p>OSGeo-Live includes overviews of some of the key OGC standards in simple language so they can be understood by people without a technical background.</p>
                     <p>Building Spatial Data Infrastructures using standards, facilitates interoperability between proprietary and open source applications. It facilitates sharing data between agencies. It reduces long term costs associated with data maintenance, and it reduces long term project risk by avoiding dependence upon proprietary formats or products, thus avoiding vendor lock-in.</p>

                     <p>GRASS GIS provides powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing. It includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.</p>
                     <p>It includes over 400 built-in analysis modules and 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes.</p>
                     <p>With over 30 years of continuous development, GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available. It is capable of very powerful analysis, but may not be as simple to get started with as other offerings with more of a geodata viewer focus. Many Open Source projects make use of GRASS's algorithms.</p>

                     <p>R is a powerful, widely-used software environment for statistical computing and graphics which excels at analyzing and processing geographic data sets. Geospatial analysis capabilities provide access to a large number of traditional and state of the art algorithms.</p>
                     <p>R and its packages are able to process point, line, polygon and grid data. Users can accomplish a broad array of tasks such as: image classification and statistical analysis to infer spatial relationships and patterns of features.</p>
                     <p>The core R interface is a command line window which provides excellent flexibility and control but tends to lengthen the time required to become a proficient user when compared to a graphical user interface.  Fortunately R is well documented which eases the learning process.</p>
