<h1>R 2.8.1</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is a language and environment for
   statistical computing and graphics. It is a 
   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a> which is similar to 
   the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories 
   (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. 
   R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some 
   important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.
<p>
R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, 
classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) 
and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the 
vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an 
Open Source route to participation in that activity.
<p>
One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality 
plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. 
Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices 
in graphics, but the user retains full control.
<p>
R is available as Free Software under the terms of the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software 
Foundation</a>'s <a href="http://www.R-project.org/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a> 
in source code form. It compiles and 
runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems 
(including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

<h3>The R environment</h3>
<p>
R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, 
calculation and graphical display. It includes
an effective data handling and storage facility,
a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, 
and a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes 
conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.
The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and 
coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and 
inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.
<p>
R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users 
to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system 
is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow 
the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and 
Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C 
code to manipulate R objects directly.
<p>
Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an 
environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be 
extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with 
the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of 
Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.
<p>
R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply 
comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy..</p>
