Components on OSGeoLive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

50+ Open Source Geospatial Applications

Consistent Overviews & Quickstarts

Sample Datasets


Translations


.. speaker notes
  OSGeoLive is a self-contained bootable USB, based on the Lubuntu Linux
  distribution, that is pre-installed and pre-configured with over 50 of the
  best GeoSpatial Open Source applications along It contains overview and
  quickstart documentation for each application, as well as documentation
  about key OGC spatial standards.
  The Quickstarts use sample datasets that are provided.
  Overviews and Quickstarts are translated in several languages.

DVD / USB / Virtual Machine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/presentation/virtual_machine_usb.png

.. speaker notes
   OSGeoLive can be run from a DVD, USB flash drive, installed into a Virtual
   Machine, or installed onto your hard drive.  This presentation provides a
   lightning overview of all applications installed on OSGeoLive, which
   effectively gives you a birds eye view of the breadth of robust GeoSpatial
   Open Source Software available.
   The USB stick is ideal for
   handing out at conferences, using in workshops, and trialling a range of Open
   Source Software.

Quality Criteria
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Established, stable, working software

Active community `Metrics <https://live.osgeo.org/en/metrics.html>`__

.. image:: /images/presentation/metrics.png
   :height: 400

.. speaker notes
   OSGeoLive helps new users quickly find quality GIS applications from the
   myriads of options.  OSGeoLive only accepts established open source
   projects, and users can then verify the application works by running it on
   OSGeoLive.  This slide shows the OpenHUB metrics page, which shows the
   community size and activity.

Production & Marketing Pipeline
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/presentation/pipeline.png
   :height: 600

.. speaker notes
  * OSGeoLive provides a production and marketing pipeline, providing value to
    a whole range of user groups.
  * Developers who package and support testing of their applications on
    OSGeoLive get their applications marketed at conferences, workshops and on
    the web.
  * Document writers get their documentation reviewed, translated into multiple
    languages and published.
  * Translators are provided with quality source documentation, and a publish
    through OSGeo web pages.
  * Conference organisers welcome presentations which explain the breadth of
    Geospatial Open Source, often having a VIP present a derivative of the
    OSGeoLive during keynote presentations, and adding value to delegates by
    giving away an OSGeoLive DVD or USB.
  * Geospatial educators and workshop presenters use the stable OGeo-Live
    Virtual Machine or USB for practical class room settings.
  * Which all leads to Architects and Developers discovering, and then incorporating
    Open Source Geospatial software in their projects.


Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)

.. speaker notes
  Set up in 2006, the OSGeo Foundation is non-profit for the geospatial
  community which fosters an open approach to software, standards, education,
  research and data.  It supports with advocacy, events, organisation and legal
  matters.  OSGeoLive derives its name from the Open Source GeoSpatial
  Foundation, or OSGeo for short.

* Interoperability
* Future Proof
* Return on Investment

.. speaker notes
  * Open Source applications have a reputation for excellent standards compliance. Notably, the OGC uses Open Source
    projects when defining reference implementations for standards.
  * Standards supported by included projects are listed in the Project Overviews.
  * Building Spatial Data Infrastructures using standards, facilitates interoperability between proprietary and open
    source applications.
  * It facilitates sharing data between agencies.
  * It reduces long term costs associated with data maintenance,
  * and it reduces long term project risk by avoiding dependence upon proprietary formats or products, thus avoiding vendor lock-in.
