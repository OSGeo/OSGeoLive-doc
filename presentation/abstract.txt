:Title: Lightning Overview of the best Geospatial Open Source

:Description:

This presentation provides a lightning overview of the breadth of quality geospatial open source applications, which are available for the full range of geospatial use cases, including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation of data.

The presentation is based upon documentation from OSGeoLive, which is a self-contained DVD, USB thumb drive and Virtual Machine, based on Lubuntu.  It includes over 50 of the best geospatial, open source applications, pre-configured with data, project overviews and quick-starts, translated into multiple languages. It is an excellent tool for demonstrating GeoSpatial Open Source, using in tutorials and workshops, or providing to potential new users.

This presentation is very useful for anyone wishing to gain a high level understanding of the breadth of geospatial open source available, and the latest version of this presentation is often presented by VIP presenters at the start of spatial conferences to help attendees select targeted presentations later in the conference.
