"The `INSPIRE Directive <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu>`__ aims to create a "
"European Union spatial data infrastructure (SDI) for the purposes of "
"environmental policies. This European SDI enables the sharing of "
"environmental spatial information among public sector organisations, "
"facilitates public access to spatial information and assist in policy-making"
" across boundaries. INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial "
"information established and operated by the 27 Member States of the European"
" Union. The Directive (see the `full text <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-"
"content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32007L0002&from=EN>`__) came into force on 15 "
"May 2007 and is implemented in various stages, with full implementation "
"required by 2021. INSPIRE is on a technical level based on international "
"standards, mainly those developed by the :doc:`OGC <ogc_overview>` and `ISO "
"<https://www.iso.org>`__."

"La `Direttiva INSPIRE <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu>`__ mira a creare una "
"infrastruttura dati territoriali (IDT), a sostegno delle politiche "
"ambientali. Tale IDT europea consente la condivisione di dati territoriali "
"sull'ambiente fra enti pubblici, facilita l'accesso pubblico ai dati "
"territoriali e assiste nella definizione di politiche attraverso i confini. "
"INSPIRE si basa sulle infrastrutture dati territoriali create e gestite dai "
"27 Stati Membri dell'Unione Europea. La Direttiva (si veda il `testo "
"completo <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-"
"content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32007L0002&from=EN>`__) è entrata in vigore il"
" 15 maggio 2007 e viene implementata attraverso vari stadi, richiedendo una "
"completa implementazione entro il 2021. Tecnicamente INSPIRE si basa su "
"standard internazionali, soprattutto quelli sviluppati da :doc:`OGC "
"<ogc_overview>` e `ISO <https://www.iso.org>`__."
