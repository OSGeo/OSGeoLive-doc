msgid "ZOO-Project provides a developer friendly Web Processing Service (WPS) framework for creating and chaining Web Processing Services. A WPS provides web access to functions which run spatial algorithms. ZOO-Project supports many programming languages and comes with three demo applications. The first uses the simple spatialtools services based on the :doc:`GEOS <geos_overview>` and :doc:`OGR <gdal_overview>` libraries, the second showcase Voronoi and Delaunay triangulation (from the CGAL library) and the third present how to interract with OTB applications runninng as WPS services."

msgid "ZOO is based on a 'WPS Service Kernel' which constitutes the ZOO's core system (aka ZOO Kernel). The latter is able to load dynamic libraries and to handle them as on-demand Web services. The ZOO Kernel is written in C language, but supports several common programming languages in order to connect to numerous libraries and above all to simplify the Web service end-developer's job."

msgid "A ZOO service is a link composed of a metadata file (.zcfg) and the code for the corresponding implementation. The metadata file describes all the available functions which can be called using a WPS Exec Request, as well as the desired input/output. Services contain the algorithms and functions, and can now be implemented in C/C++, Fortran, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, C# and JavaScript."
