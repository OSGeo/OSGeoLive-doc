msgid "R is essentially a command-line program, although graphical user interfaces are available. You type a line of code at the prompt, press return, and the R interpreter evaluates it and prints the result."

msgid "Don't fear the command line - it is a source of great power. Using the up and down arrows to recall commands so you can edit mistakes. Hit CTRL-C if get stuck and you should get the prompt back."

msgid "The main prompt in R is ``>``, but there is also the continuation prompt ``+``, which appears if R expects more input to make a valid expression. You'll see this if you forget a closing bracket or parenthesis."

msgid "You might be wondering what the mysterious 'one' in square brackets is doing in the output. This is telling you that the result is one number. R can store things in one-dimensional vectors, two-dimensional matrices, and multi-dimensional arrays. There are many functions that can generate these things. Here's a simple sequence:"

msgid "Data frames are data structures that mirror the kind of structure found in an RDBMS such as Postgres or MySQL. Each row can be thought of as a record, with columns being like fields in a database. As in a database, each field must be of the same type for each record."

#: ../../build/doc/quickstart/R_quickstart.rst:229
msgid "We add these points to the base map, scaling their size by scaled square root of the population (because that makes a symbol with area proportional to population), set the colour to red and the plotting character to a solid blob:"

msgid "In the past, the documentation for R packages tended to be tersely-written help pages for each function. Now package authors are encouraged to write a 'vignette' as a friendly introduction to the package. If you run the ``vignette()`` function with no arguments you will get the list of those vignettes on your system. Try ``vignette(\"sf1\")`` for a slightly technical introduction to the R spatial package."
