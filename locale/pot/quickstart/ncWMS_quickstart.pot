msgid "ncWMS is a Web Map Service which allows the fast visualisation of data from NetCDF files and other sources of environmental data.  This quickstart guide describes how to explore the sample data provided using the Godiva2 web client.  For configuration and adding other data sources to the server, please consult the documentation on the `ncWMS website <https://reading-escience-centre.gitbooks.io/ncwms-user-guide/content/>`_."

To do this, click the \"lock\" link, which is the padlock icon to the right of the colour scale bar. The colour scale range will then not be changed when a new variable is loaded and the scale range cannot be edited manually. However, the colour palette and the number of colour bands can still be modified while the scale range is locked. Click the lock icon again to make the colour scale editable."
