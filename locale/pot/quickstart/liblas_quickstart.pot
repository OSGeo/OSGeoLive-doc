msgid "libLAS is a C/C++ library for reading and writing the very common LAS LiDAR format. The ASPRS LAS format is a sequential binary format used to store data from LiDAR sensors and by LiDAR processing software for data interchange and archival."

msgid "LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a form of high precision range detection much like a radar system that uses laser light as the electromagnetic emission. One of LiDAR systems' products is a \"point cloud\" data product that can be conceptualized as a series of point measurements representing distance from the sensor to a returned emission. A common storage format for these point cloud data is ASPRS LAS format."

msgid "The libLAS 'command-line utilities' provide the bulk of user-facing operational software for libLAS, although the underlying libLAS library is what powers them.  Below is a listing of common operations that you might want to do on LAS data, and the utilities and approaches to take to complete those tasks. The demo data can be found in :file:`/home/user/data/las/srs.las`"

msgid "All LAS data are in some sort of coordinate system, even if that coordinate system is not described in the LAS file.  For terrestrial LAS data, these coordinate system descriptions often map to coordinate systems described by the `EPSG`_ database.  Another source of information about coordinate systems in http://spatialreference.org."

msgid "The --no-check option tells lasinfo to only print the header information for the file and to not scan through all of the points.  For a 10 point file, this of course isn't much of a concern, but with a 50 or 500 million point file, it isn't worth waiting for a full scan of the data if all you want is header information."

msgid "The ``srs.las`` file had a scale of 0.01, or two decimal places of precision for its X, Y, and Z coordinates. For UTM data, this is ok, because it implies an implicit precision of 1 cm. For decimal degree data of the unprojected Plate Carrée coordinate system, it causes us to lose a bunch of precision. We need to set our scale values to something that can hold more precision in our case:"
