Python knowledge is recommended, although you can do without by running the application from OSGeoLive."

The service will automatically detect (accept header) that you are using a web browser and will return the HTML representation of features. Notice in the top right corner explicit links to override the accept header and request specific representations of the feature (``?f=json``)."

msgid "OGC API’s have been developed with the `W3C Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices <https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp>`_ in mind. An important aspect of these best practices is search engine optimization. Pygeoapi adds some crawl optimizations on top of the requirements of the Open API standards; collection metadata can be crawled by search engines in a structured way, with the goal to make the collections discoverable in tools like Google Dataset Search. To evaluate the structured data capabilities you can use the Structured Data Testing tools of Yandex or Google. Copy the html source of the countries collection page (or the url of a collection page of an online pygeoapi instance) into a structured data testing tool and evaluate what structured data the tool is able to extract from it. The search engine will use that information in its datasets index."
