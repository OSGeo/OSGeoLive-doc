"libLAS is a C/C++ library for reading and writing the very common LAS LiDAR "
"format. The ASPRS LAS format is a sequential binary format used to store "
"data from LiDAR sensors and by LiDAR processing software for data "
"interchange and archival."

"LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a form of high precision range "
"detection much like a radar system that uses laser light as the "
"electromagnetic emission. One of LiDAR systems' products is a \"point "
"cloud\" data product that can be conceptualized as a series of point "
"measurements representing distance from the sensor to a returned emission. A"
" common storage format for these point cloud data is ASPRS LAS format."

"The libLAS 'command-line utilities' provide the bulk of user-facing "
"operational software for libLAS, although the underlying libLAS library is "
"what powers them.  Below is a listing of common operations that you might "
"want to do on LAS data, and the utilities and approaches to take to complete"
" those tasks. The demo data can be found in "

"All LAS data are in some sort of coordinate system, even if that coordinate "

"The --no-check option tells lasinfo to only print the header information for"
" the file and to not scan through all of the points.  For a 10 point file, "
"this of course isn't much of a concern, but with a 50 or 500 million point "
"file, it isn't worth waiting for a full scan of the data if all you want is "
"header information."

"The ``srs.las`` file had a scale of 0.01, or two decimal places of precision"
" for its X, Y, and Z coordinates. For UTM data, this is ok, because it "
"implies an implicit precision of 1 cm. For decimal degree data of the "
"unprojected Plate Carrée coordinate system, it causes us to lose a bunch of "
"precision. We need to set our scale values to something that can hold more "
"precision in our case:"
