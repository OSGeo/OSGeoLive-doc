"Rasdaman is a Big Data Engine for flexible ad-hoc analytics on multi-"
"dimensional spatio-temporal sensor, image, simulation, and statistics data "
"of unlimited size. The Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) query language"
" is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard wich allows filtering and "
"processing of multi-dimensional raster coverages, such as sensor, "
"simulation, image, and statistics data using web services. The WCPS queries "
"are translated to rasdaman query language, rasql, and are executed on "
"rasdaman. This quick start shows how to access and manipulate an example 2D "
"coverage using WCPS language."

"The first step before trying any of the following queries is to start "
"rasdaman and Tomcat. Open the *Databases* directory on the Desktop, and then"
" *Start Rasdaman Server*. Allow two to three minutes for rasdaman and "
"especially Tomcat to fully start (once the `rasdaman web client "
"<http://localhost:8080/rasdaman/ows>`_ loads in the browser)."
