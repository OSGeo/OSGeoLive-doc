"GeoExt is a JavaScript library that runs in the browser, it combines and "
"enhances the ExtJS framework and OpenLayers library. This quick start "
"details the steps to create a rich web application using GeoExt components "
"in less than 200 lines of code. We will be using the installed MapServer web"
" services on OSGeoLive a MapServer to supply map layers to the application. "
"Completing the steps below will result in the demo GeoExt application at "
"http://localhost/geoext/."
