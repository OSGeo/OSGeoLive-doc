"The Re3gistry 2 is a reusable open source solution for managing and sharing "
"\"reference codes\". It provides a consistent central access point where "
"labels and descriptions for reference codes can be easily browsed by humans "
"and retrieved by machines.  Reference codes are exchanged between "
"applications to uniquely reference some ‘thing’. They can be used to define "
"sets of permissible values for a data field or to provide a reference or "
"context for the data being exchanged. Examples are enumerations, controlled "
"vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri or, simply, ‘lists of things’.  The "
"Re3gistry 2 supports organisations in managing and updating reference codes "
"in a consistent way."
