"The `INSPIRE Directive <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu>`__ aims to create a"
" European Union spatial data infrastructure (SDI) for the purposes of "
"environmental policies. This European SDI enables the sharing of "
"environmental spatial information among public sector organisations, "
"facilitates public access to spatial information and assist in policy-"
"making across boundaries. INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for "
"spatial information established and operated by the 27 Member States of "
"the European Union. The Directive (see the `full text <https://eur-"
"lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32007L0002&from=EN>`__)"
" came into force on 15 May 2007 and is implemented in various stages, "
"with full implementation required by 2021. INSPIRE is on a technical "
"level based on international standards, mainly those developed by the "
":doc:`OGC <ogc_overview>` and `ISO <https://www.iso.org>`__."

"The datasets falling under the scope of the INSPIRE Directive are grouped"
" into 34 cross-sectoral categories named `spatial data themes "
"<https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/Themes/Data-Specifications/2892>`__, which "
"are defined in the Annexes of the Directive and reflect two main types of"
" data: geospatial reference data, presented in Annex I and partly Annex "
"II, which define a location reference that the remaining domain-specific "
"themes (in Annex III and partly Annex II) can then refer to."

"Currently, more than 7,000 European public institutions contribute their "
"data to INSPIRE. A significant share of them make use of OSGeo software "
"projects throughout the implementation process. :doc:`OSGeoLive "

"multiple application domains included in the available software "
