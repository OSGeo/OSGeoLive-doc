"R is a powerful, widely used software environment for statistical "
"computing and graphics which excels at analyzing and processing "
"geographic data sets. Geospatial analysis capabilities within R are "
"available in R packages (modules that extend the capabilities of R) that "
"provide access to a huge number of traditional and state of the art "
"algorithms (). R and its packages are able to process point, line, "
"polygon, networks, grid data (etc.)."

"Users can accomplish a broad array of tasks such as: image "
"classification, statistical analysis to infer spatial relationships and "
"patterns of features, and others listed in the core features below. The "
"functions available via R complement and advance capabilities found in "
"GIS and image processing software. Using packages for parallelisation "
"users can drastically reduce computational time and increase these "
"capability. Several packages provide connection with other OSGeo tools "
"and software. You can easily plug R with GRASS-GIS, Qgis, postgreSQL and "
"postGIS."

"The core R interface is a command line window which provides excellent "
"flexibility and control but tends to lengthen the time required to become"
" a proficient user when compared to software with a graphical user "
"interface (GUI). Fortunately R is well documented on the web site which "
"eases the learning process. Scripts are often used to automate processing"
" steps but there are GUIs, the leading one being RStudio "
"(https://www.rstudio.com)."

"R is an implementation of the S programming language and there is "
"significant compatibility between R and legacy S and S-Plus code as well "
"as between R and the modern commercial version of S, TIBCO Spotfire S+. "
"This makes it possible to convert different versions of S code to run on "
"R without major code modifications."
