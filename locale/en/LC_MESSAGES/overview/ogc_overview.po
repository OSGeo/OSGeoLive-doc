"The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) was founded in 1994 to make geographic "
"information an integral part of the world’s information infrastructure. OGC "
"members – technology providers and technology users – collaboratively "
"develop open interface standards and associated encoding standards, and also"
" best practices, that enable developers to create information systems that "
"can easily exchange “geospatial” information and instructions with other "
"information systems. Requirements range from complex scheduling and control "
"of Earth observation satellites to displaying simple map images on the Web "
"and encoding location in just a few bytes for geo-tagging and messaging. A "
"look at the `OGC Domain Working Groups "
"<http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/wg>`_ shows the wide scope of"
" current activity in the OGC."
