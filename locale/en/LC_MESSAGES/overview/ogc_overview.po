"The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international consortium of "
"more than 500 businesses, government agencies, research organizations, "
"and universities driven to make geospatial (location) information and "
"services FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. OGC's "
"member-driven consensus process creates royalty free, publicly available,"
" open geospatial standards. Existing at the cutting edge, OGC actively "
"analyzes and anticipates emerging tech trends, and runs an agile, "
"collaborative Research and Development (R&D) lab - the OGC Innovation "
"Program - that builds and tests innovative prototype solutions to "
"members' use cases. OGC members together form a global forum of experts "
"and communities that use location to connect people with technology and "
"improve decision-making at all levels. OGC is committed to creating a "
"sustainable future for us, our children, and future generations. A look "
"at the `OGC Domain Working Groups "
"<https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/wg>`_ shows the wide scope of "
"current activity in the OGC."

"The OGC Standards Baseline consists of the |OGC| standards for "
"interfaces, encodings, profiles, application schemas, and best practice "
"documents. The |ORM| describes these standards and the relationships "
"between them and related ISO standards. The ORM provides an overview of "
"OGC standards and serves as a useful resource for defining architectures "
"for specific applications."

"In 2020, the `OGC API <https://ogcapi.ogc.org/>`_ family of standards "
"started to be developed to make it easy for anyone to provide geospatial "
"data to the web. These standards build upon the legacy of the OGC Web "
"Service standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, etc.), but define resource-centric"
" APIs that take advantage of modern web development practices. This web "
"page provides information on these standards in a consolidated location. "
"These standards are being constructed as \"building blocks\" that can be "
"used to assemble novel APIs for web access to geospatial content. The "
"building blocks are defined not only by the requirements of the specific "
"standards, but also through interoperability prototyping and testing in "
"OGC's Innovation Program."
