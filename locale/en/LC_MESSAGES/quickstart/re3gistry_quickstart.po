"The Re3gistry 2 is a reusable open source solution for managing and "
"sharing \"reference codes\". It provides a consistent central access "
"point where labels and descriptions for reference codes can be easily "
"browsed by humans and retrieved by machines.  Reference codes are "
"exchanged between applications to uniquely reference some ‘thing’. They "
"can be used to define sets of permissible values for a data field or to "
"provide a reference or context for the data being exchanged. Examples are"
" enumerations, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri or, simply, "
"‘lists of things’.  The Re3gistry 2 supports organisations in managing "
"and updating reference codes in a consistent way."
