"SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) is an open source "
"geographic information system (GIS) used for editing and analysing "
"spatial data. It includes a large number of modules for the analysis of "
"vector (point, line and polygon), table, grid and image data. Among "
"others the package includes modules for geostatistics, image "
"classification, projections, simulation of dynamic processes (hydrology, "
"landscape development) and terrain analysis. The functionality can be "
"accessed through a GUI, the command line or by using the C++ API."
