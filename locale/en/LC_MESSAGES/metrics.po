"Metrics provided by `OpenHUB <https://www.openhub.net/>`_ which are "
"derived from the projects' code repositories. Note these metrics have "
"known deficiencies (such as caused by repositories moving), and only "
"provide partial indications about the projects' development. Lack of "
"change in smaller, concise packages and libraries may simply reflect a "
"level of maturity and completeness."
