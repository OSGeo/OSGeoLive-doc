"The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is a collective problem-solving "
"community of more than 550 experts representing industry, government, "
"research and academia, collaborating to make geospatial (location) "
"information and services FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and "
"Reusable."

"The global OGC Community engages in a mix of activities related to "
"location-based technologies: developing consensus-based open standards "
"and best-practices; collaborating on problem solving in agile innovation "
"initiatives; participating in member meetings, events, and workshops; and"
" more."

"OGC's unique standards development process moves at the pace of "
"innovation, with constant input from technology forecasting, practical "
"prototyping, real-world testing, and community engagement. OGC bridges "
"disparate sectors, domains, and technology trends, and encourages the "
"cross-pollination of ideas between different communities of practice to "
"improve decision-making at all levels. OGC is committed to creating an "
"inclusive and sustainable future."

"The OGC Standards Baseline consists of the Open Geospatial Consortium "
"|OGC| standards for interfaces, encodings, profiles, application schemas,"
" and best practice documents. The |ORM| describes these standards and the"
" relationships between them and related ISO standards. The ORM provides "
"an overview of OGC standards and serves as a useful resource for defining"
" architectures for specific applications."

"In 2020, the `OGC API <https://ogcapi.ogc.org/>`_ family of standards "
"started to be developed to make it easy for anyone to provide geospatial "
"data to the web. These standards build upon the legacy of the OGC Web "
"Service standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, etc.), but define resource-centric"
" APIs that take advantage of modern web development practices. This web "
"page provides information on these standards in a consolidated location. "
"These standards are being constructed as \"building blocks\" that can be "
"used to assemble novel APIs for web access to geospatial content. The "
"building blocks are defined not only by the requirements of the specific "
"standards, but also through interoperability prototyping and testing in "
"OGC's Innovation Program."
