gvSIG Desktop
================================================================================

Desktop GIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

gvSIG_ is a Geographic Information System (GIS) desktop application
designed for capturing, storing, handling, analysing and deploying any kind of
referenced geographic information in order to solve complex management and
planning problems. gvSIG is known for its user-friendly interface and being
able to access all common vector and raster formats. It features
a wide range of tools for working with geographic information (query,
layout creation, geoprocessing, networks, etc.), which turns gvSIG into the
ideal tool for users working in the land realm.

gvSIG is known for:

* integrating in the same view both local and remote data through OGC standards.
* being easily extendible, allowing continuous application 
  enhancement, as well as enabling the development of tailor-made solutions.
* being available in over 20 languages (Spanish, English, German, French, 
  Italian,...) .
* being available for Windws, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms:
