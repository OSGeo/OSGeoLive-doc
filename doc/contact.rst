OSGeoLive development is coordinated via email and internet chat
(IRC) as detailed on the
`OSGeo Wiki <http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeoLive#Contact_Us>`_.

Disclaimer
================================================================================

This Live GIS disc and virtual-machine has been put together by members
of the OSGeo community to showcase their favourite Free and Open Source
(FOSS) geospatial software. We've included a number of non-OSGeo software
packages, from both the spatial and non-spatial realms, which we hope you will find to be as useful as we do. The OSGeo Foundation does not recommend or guarantee any associated software, projects, or companies found within.

`These programs are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,

Community Support
================================================================================

If you have any questions, comments, or run into any problems, please drop us a

A wealth of information is available on our `Wiki site <http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeoLive>`_,

Most packaged applications have both community and commercial support
offerings for them. Refer to specific application descriptions linked from the :doc:`Contents <./overview/overview>` for details.

In addition, there are a large number of consultancy firms world wide
