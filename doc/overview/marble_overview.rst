Virtual globe and world atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Marble is an open source KDE Education Project program similar
to `NASA World Wind <https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/>`_ or
Google Earth. Besides choosing any number of maps to view on your
globe (including `OpenStreetMaps <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`_), you are
encouraged to include a KDE Marble widget in your application.

Explore the neighborhood with Marble's rich set of city and street 
level maps. Search for addresses and places of interest. Marble takes 
care of querying various search backends and presents their results in 
a unified view. Calculate pedestrian, bike and motorcar routes with 
ease - online and offline, with an arbitrary number of via points.

Start exploring the world. View clouds and sun shadow, follow satellites 
and space stations and display their orbits, all updated in real-time. 
Travel back in time and learn about historic views of our planet using 
maps from past centuries. Earth is not enough? Marble also offers maps 
of the moon and other planets.
