Tools for mapping the world
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`_ is a project aimed
squarely at creating and providing free geographic data such as street
maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most maps
you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their
use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive or
unexpected ways.

A number of programs have been included: JOSM, Merkaartor, Osmosis, Osm2pgsql,
and a number of small command utilities. In addition recent sample data for
the FOSS4G host city and a number of JOSM plugins have been included.
