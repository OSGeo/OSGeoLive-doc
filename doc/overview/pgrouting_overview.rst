GIS Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pgRouting extends the
:doc:`postgis_overview`/`PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org>`__
geospatial database to provide geospatial routing and other network analysis functionality.

Advantages of the database routing approach are:

* Data and attributes can be modified by many clients, like :doc:`qgis_overview`
  and :doc:`udig_overview` through JDBC, ODBC, or directly using Pl/pgSQL.
  The clients can either be PCs or mobile devices.
* Data changes can be reflected instantaneously through the routing engine.
  There is no need for precalculation.
* The "cost" parameter can be dynamically calculated through SQL and its value can come
  from multiple fields or tables.

pgRouting is available under the GPLv2+ license and is supported by a growing community
of individuals, businesses and organizations.

.. presentation-note
    pgRouting extends the PostGIS database to provide geospatial routing functionality
    so you can apply queries like finding the shortest path between points from within
    the database, thus simplifying both routing functionality and maintenance of data.
