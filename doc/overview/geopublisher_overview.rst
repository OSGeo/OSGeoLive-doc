Geopublisher is an atlas authoring system which enables easy publication of geo-data, documents, images, videos, and statistics in form of digital multimedia atlases. These atlases are effectively a minimal, pre-configured, end-user GIS which offers selected functionality only where it is meaningful.

Geopublisher provides tools for quality assurance and multilingual meta-data management. No in-depth knowledge of HTML, SLD or XML is required to create an atlas. Atlases can be directly published on CD, DVD, memory stick, external hard-drive or the Internet. The software is platform-independent.

Geopublisher's unique features make it especially applicable in the fields of international research, participatory GIS, capacity building, and development cooperation.
