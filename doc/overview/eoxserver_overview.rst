About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EOxServer is a server for presenting big Earth Observation (EO) data
archives and metadata via Open Standards.

Earth Observation data currently supported includes 2D raster data generally
acquired using sensors on satellites or aircrafts and including information
about the time of acquisition and the footprint on planet Earth. It is
typically used to monitor Earth's natural and built environment.

EOxServer builds upon an Open Source stack of software which includes
Python, :doc:`MapServer <mapserver_overview>`, Django/GeoDjango, :doc:`GDAL
<gdal_overview>`, PROJ, and a :doc:`SpatiaLite <spatialite_overview>` or
:doc:`PostGIS <postgis_overview>` database.
