About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Re3gistry 2 is a reusable open source solution for managing and sharing
"reference codes". Initially developed as a central component of the EU's
:doc:`INSPIRE <inspire_overview>` infrastructure, it provides a consistent
central access point where labels and descriptions for reference codes can be
easily browsed by humans and retrieved by machines. Reference codes are
exchanged between applications to uniquely reference some ‘thing’. They can be
used to define sets of permissible values for a data field or to provide a
reference or context for the data being exchanged. Examples are enumerations,
controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri or, simply, ‘lists of things’.
The Re3gistry 2 supports organisations in managing and updating reference codes
in a consistent way. The Re3gistry software version numbers comply with the
Semantic Versioning Specification 2.0.0.
