Statistical Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

R is a powerful, widely used software environment for statistical
computing and graphics which excels at analyzing and processing
geographic data sets. Geospatial analysis capabilities within R are
available in R packages (modules that extend the capabilities of R)
that provide access to a huge number of traditional and state of the
art algorithms (). R and its packages are able to process point,
line, polygon, networks, grid data (etc.).

Users can accomplish a broad array of tasks such as: image classification,
statistical analysis to infer spatial relationships and patterns of features,
and others listed in the core features below. The functions available via R
complement and advance capabilities found in GIS and image processing software.
Using packages for parallelisation users can drastically reduce computational time
and increase these capability. Several packages provide connection with other
OSGeo tools and software. You can easily plug R with GRASS-GIS, Qgis, postgreSQL
and postGIS.

The core R interface is a command line window which provides excellent
flexibility and control but tends to lengthen the time required to
become a proficient user when compared to software with a graphical
user interface (GUI). Fortunately R is well documented on the web site
which eases the learning process. Scripts are often used to automate
processing steps but there are GUIs, the leading one being
RStudio (https://rstudio.com).

R is an implementation of the S programming language and there is
significant compatibility between R and legacy S and S-Plus code as
well as between R and the modern commercial version of S, TIBCO
Spotfire S+. This makes it possible to convert different
versions of S code to run on R without major code modifications.
