The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international consortium of more than 500 businesses, government agencies, research organizations, and universities driven to make geospatial (location) information and services FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. OGC's member-driven consensus process creates royalty free, publicly available, open geospatial standards. Existing at the cutting edge, OGC actively analyzes and anticipates emerging tech trends, and runs an agile, collaborative Research and Development (R&D) lab - the OGC Innovation Program - that builds and tests innovative prototype solutions to members' use cases. OGC members together form a global forum of experts and communities that use location to connect people with technology and improve decision-making at all levels. OGC is committed to creating a sustainable future for us, our children, and future generations. A look at the `OGC
Domain Working Groups <https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/wg>`_
shows the wide scope of current activity in the OGC.

The OGC Standards Baseline consists of the |OGC| standards for interfaces, encodings,
profiles, application schemas, and best practice documents. The |ORM|
describes these
standards and the relationships between them and related ISO standards. The ORM
provides an overview of OGC standards and serves as a useful resource for
defining architectures for specific applications.

In 2020, the `OGC API <https://ogcapi.ogc.org/>`_ family of standards started to be developed to make it easy for anyone to provide geospatial data to the web. These standards build upon the legacy of the OGC Web Service standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, etc.), but define resource-centric APIs that take advantage of modern web development practices. This web page provides information on these standards in a consolidated location. These standards are being constructed as "building blocks" that can be used to assemble novel APIs for web access to geospatial content. The building blocks are defined not only by the requirements of the specific standards, but also through interoperability prototyping and testing in OGC's Innovation Program.
