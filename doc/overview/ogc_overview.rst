The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is a collective problem-solving community of more than 550 experts representing industry, government, research and academia, collaborating to make geospatial (location) information and services FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

The global OGC Community engages in a mix of activities related to location-based technologies:
developing consensus-based open standards and best-practices;
collaborating on problem solving in agile innovation initiatives; participating in member meetings, events, and workshops; and more.

OGC's unique standards development process moves at the pace of innovation, with constant input from technology forecasting, practical prototyping, real-world testing, and community engagement.
OGC bridges disparate sectors, domains, and technology trends, and encourages the cross-pollination of ideas between different communities of practice to improve decision-making at all levels. OGC is committed to creating an inclusive and sustainable future.

A look at the `OGC Domain Working Groups <https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/wg>`_ shows the wide scope of current activity in the OGC.

The OGC Standards Baseline consists of the Open Geospatial Consortium |OGC| standards for interfaces, encodings,
profiles, application schemas, and best practice documents. The |ORM|
describes these
standards and the relationships between them and related ISO standards. The ORM
provides an overview of OGC standards and serves as a useful resource for
defining architectures for specific applications.

In 2020, the `OGC API <https://ogcapi.ogc.org/>`_ family of standards started to be developed to make it easy for anyone to provide geospatial data to the web. These standards build upon the legacy of the OGC Web Service standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, etc.), but define resource-centric APIs that take advantage of modern web development practices. This web page provides information on these standards in a consolidated location. These standards are being constructed as "building blocks" that can be used to assemble novel APIs for web access to geospatial content. The building blocks are defined not only by the requirements of the specific standards, but also through interoperability prototyping and testing in OGC's Innovation Program.
