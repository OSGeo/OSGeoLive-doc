The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) was founded in 1994 to make geographic
information an integral part of the world’s information infrastructure. OGC
members – technology providers and technology users – collaboratively develop
open interface standards and associated encoding standards, and also best
practices, that enable developers to create information systems that can easily
exchange “geospatial” information and instructions with other information
systems. Requirements range from complex scheduling and control of Earth
observation satellites to displaying simple map images on the Web and encoding
location in just a few bytes for geo-tagging and messaging. A look at the `OGC
Domain Working Groups <https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/wg>`_
shows the wide scope of current activity in the OGC.

The OGC Standards Baseline consists of the |OGC| standards
for interfaces, encodings,
profiles, application schemas, and best practice documents. The |ORM|
describes these
standards and the relationships between them and related ISO standards. The ORM
provides an overview of OGC standards and serves as a useful resource for
defining architectures for specific applications.

In developing a Web services application using OGC standards (and in learning
about the relationships between OGC standards) it helps to think of publish,
find and bind as the key functions for applications in a Web services
environment.

   * Publish: Resource providers advertise their resources.
   * Find: End users and their applications can discover resources that they need at run-time.
   * Bind: End users and their applications can access and exercise resources at run-time.

Most of the OGC standards developed in recent years are standards for the Web
services environment, and these standards are collectively referred to as OGC
Web Services (OWS). A `comprehensive list of standards
<https://www.ogc.org/standards/>`__ is available.
