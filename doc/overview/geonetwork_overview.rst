.. presentation-note
    GeoNetwork provides a catalogue, which is used to create, maintain and and search metadata about specific datasets.
    Metadata is "data about data", storing such things as creation-date, author, title, area-of-interest, and so on. Metadata is usually encoded as XML files, following international standards.
