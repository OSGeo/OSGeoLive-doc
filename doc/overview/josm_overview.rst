Desktop Editor for OpenStreetMap data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JOSM is a feature rich, extensible, offline desktop editor for OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, written in Java.

It supports loading stand-alone GPX tracks and GPX track data as well as editing existing nodes (points), ways (lines), metadata tags (name/value information) and relations (ordered sequence of points and lines) from the OSM database.
GPX tracks, are usually downloaded in advance from a GPS receiver or from other sources.

A number of specialised plugins have been written for JOSM, which are available for download and install.
