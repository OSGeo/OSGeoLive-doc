A JavaScript Toolkit for Rich Web Mapping Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GeoExt is Open Source and enables building desktop-like GIS applications through the web. It is a JavaScript framework that combines the GIS functionality of 
`OpenLayers <https://openlayers.org/>`_ with the user interface of the `ExtJS <https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`_ library provided by `Sencha <https://www.sencha.com/>`_. 

User interface components include a map panel, layer tree panel, feature grid, and an overview map. GeoExt components can be used just like any other ExtJS component
and can be easily configured and extended. Lower level classes are also available allowing OpenLayers features and layers to be used as ExtJS data models, and for various
map layer types to be serialized. 

GeoExt3 is dual licensed. The license you choose depends on the license of the framework ExtJS you use with it. 
If you are using the GPL v3 version of the ExtJS framework you will use it under GPLv3. If you own a Sencha ExtJS Commercial License, you 
have the right to use GeoExt3 under the BSD License.
