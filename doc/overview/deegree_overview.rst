* Supports KVP, XML and SOAP requests
* GML 2/3.0/3.1/3.2 output/input
* Support for GetGmlObject requests and XLinks
* High performance and excellent scalability
* On-the-fly coordinate transformation
* Designed for rich data models from the bottom up
* Backends support flexible mapping of GML application schemas to relational models
* ISO 19107-compliant geometry model: Complex geometries (e.g. non-linear curves)
* Advanced filter expression support based on XPath 1.0
* Supports numerous backends, such as PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, MS SQL Server, Shapefiles or GML instance documents

**WMS**

* Implements WMS standards 1.1.1 and 1.3.0
* Extensive support for styling languages SLD/SE versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0
* High performance and excellent scalability
* High quality rendering

* Easy configuration of HTML and other output formats for GetFeatureInfo responses
* Uses stream-based data access with minimal memory footprint
* Nearly complete support for raster symbolizing as defined in SE (with some extensions)
* Complete support for TIME/ELEVATION and other dimensions for both feature and raster data
* Supports numerous backends, such as PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, Shapefiles or GML instance documents
* Can render rich data models directly

**WMTS**

* Implements Basic WMTS standard 1.0.0 (KVP)
* High performance and excellent scalability
* Supports different backends, such as GeoTIFF, remote WMS or file system tile image hierarchies
* Supports on-the-fly caching (using EHCache)
* Supports GetFeatureInfo for remote WMS backends

**CSW**

* Implements CSW standard 2.0.2
* Fully transactional
* Supports KVP, XML and SOAP requests
* High performance and excellent scalability
* ISO Metadata Application Profile 1.0.0
* Pluggable and modular dataaccess layer allows to add support for new APs and backends
* Modular inspector architecture allows to validate records to be inserted against various criteria
* Standard inspectors: schema validity, identifier integrity, INSPIRE requirements
* Handles all defined queryable properties (for Dublin Core as well as ISO profile)
* Complex filter expressions

**WPS**

* Implements WPS standard 1.0.0
* Supports KVP, XML and SOAP requests
* Pluggable process provider layer
* Easy-to-use API for implementing Java processes
