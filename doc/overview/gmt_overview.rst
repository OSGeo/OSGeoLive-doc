The Generic Mapping Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT is a collection of tools that allow users to manipulate (x,y) and
(x,y,z) data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding,
projecting, etc.) and produce Encapsulated PostScript File (EPS)
illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots through contour maps to
artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective views in black and
white, gray tone, hachure patterns, and 24-bit color.

GMT supports many common map projections plus linear, log, and power
scaling, and comes with support data such as coastlines, rivers, and
political boundaries.
