gvSIG is a Geographic Information System (GIS), that is, a desktop application
designed for capturing, storing, handling, analyzing and deploying any kind of
referenced geographic information in order to solve complex management and
planning problems. gvSIG is known for having a user-friendly interface, being
able to access the most common formats, both vector and raster ones. It
features a wide range of tools for working with geographic-like information
(query tools, layout creation, geoprocessing, networks, etc.), which turns
gvSIG into the ideal tool for users working in the land realm.

.. contents:: Contents
   :local:

.. note:: If gvSIG user interface becomes unresponsive, try :kbd:`Alt+f` to open
          the file menu for example. User interface should work again, then. This
          bug only happens in the gvSIG distro for OSGeoLive. It doesn't appear
          in a normal gvSIG installation.

.. note:: Note for version gvSIG 2.3.1: To load raster files the user must
          have write permission in the folder where the file is. Otherwise the
          application will ask for a valid folder (with write permission). Since
          the "user" user doesn't have write permission in the "data" folder, it
          will be necessary to select, when asked, a folder where the user does
          have write permission, like for example, "/home/user".

Start gvSIG and create a view
=============================

#. Select gvSIG from the application menu, :menuselection:`Geospatial --> Desktop GIS --> gvSIG`. The application usually takes about a minute to startup.

#. By default gvSIG opens with an empty project file with the 'View' document
   type selected. However, on OSGeoLive, gvSIG has been configured to
   start with a default project. Click on the :guilabel:`New Project` button or go to
   :menuselection:`File --> New Project`. When prompted, you can select
   :guilabel:`Discard Changes` as we won't be using the last project.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`New` button to create a view. It will be opened automatically.

Define the projection of your view
==================================

#. Select :menuselection:`View --> Properties`.

   .. image:: /images/projects/gvsig/gvsig_qs_002_.png
     :scale: 55

#. For the :guilabel:`Current projection`, click on the :guilabel:`...` button.
   This will open the **New CRS** dialog.
#. Using the dropdown list for :guilabel:`Type`, select EPSG.
#. Enter the EPSG code for the Coordinate Reference System. For this example
   we are using EPSG=4326, which is the WGS84 2D Geographic Projection. Then
   click on the :guilabel:`Search` button. This will list the selected CRS in the table
   below the search input field.
#. Select :guilabel:`OK` to return to the **View Properties** dialog. The EPSG code is now 4326 and that the map units have changed to degrees.
#. Select :guilabel:`OK` to return to the **Project Manager**.

* (1) The view window consists of three zones.
* (2) The top-left cell contains a list of vector or raster layers being used in
  the view (i.e. Table-of-Contents).
* (3) The bottom-left cell displays the extent of the main view over a selected
  vector file.
* (4) The right cell is the main display area where raster and vector data is
  rendered.

Add layers to the view
======================

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Add layer` icon in the main toolbar to open the **Add layer** dialog.
#. Select :guilabel:`Add` in the **Add layer** dialog. By default the first tab is :guilabel:`File`
   so the **Open** file dialog will appear.
#. Drill down to the ``/usr/local/share/data/natural_earth2/`` directory.
#. Select the files as shown in the picture.

.. image:: /images/projects/gvsig/gvsig_qs_006_.png
   :scale: 55

.. note:: By default all formats are shown so we can select both vector and raster files at a time by keeping pressed the :kbd:`CTRL` key.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`OK` button to return to the **Add layer** dialog.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`OK` button on the **Add layer** dialog to return to the view.


Configure the view display
==========================

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Maximize` icon for a better viewing of the data.
#. The size of the Table-of-Contents column can be adjusted using the mouse to
   help see long file names.
#. In case the raster layer is on the top it should be moved manually to the bottom.

Zoom into a region
------------------

#. By default the *Zoom in* tool is selected on the main toolbar.
#. Use the mouse pointer to draw a bounding box around South-east Australia.
   Do this by selecting the top-left corner of the bounding box, holding
   down the left-mouse-button, and dragging the bottom-right corner of
   the bounding box over the selected area. Release the left-mouse button once
   you have the approximate area defined.

Change how the layers look
==========================

Make a polygon transparent
--------------------------

#. Select the ``ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces.shp`` layer using the
   left-mouse-button and click again with the right-mouse-button.
#. Select the :menuselection:`Properties` submenu.
#. The **Layer properties** dialog box will appear.

.. image:: /images/projects/gvsig/gvsig_qs_010_.png
   :scale: 55

Change the symbology of a vector layer
--------------------------------------

#. Select the :guilabel:`Symbols` tab at the top of the **Layers properties** dialog.
#. Select :guilabel:`Choose symbol` button so the **Symbol selector** dialog appears.

Remove the fill symbol and changing the border color
----------------------------------------------------

#. Uncheck the :guilabel:`Fill color` box so the polygons are transparent.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`...` close to :guilabel:`Border color:`.
#. Choose white as color.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`OK` button to return to the **Symbol selector** dialog.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`OK` button to return to the **Layers properties** dialog.

.. image:: /images/projects/gvsig/gvsig_qs_012_.png
   :scale: 55

Change the labelling of a vector layer
--------------------------------------

#. Select the :guilabel:`Labelling` tab at the top of the **Layers properties** dialog.
#. Change the text attributes to those shown on the image, then click on the
   :guilabel:`Accept` button.

.. image:: /images/projects/gvsig/gvsig_qs_013_.png
   :scale: 55

View the result
---------------

Note that this is a very basic view showing a point, a line and a polygon vector
file superimposed over a raster file. It is just as easy to have an aerial
photograph or Digital Terrain Model as a backdrop to your vector data, or
to show other vector data stored in different formats.

Add an overview or locator
==========================

Select :menuselection:`View --> Locator setup`.

.. image:: /images/projects/gvsig/gvsig_qs_016_.png
   :scale: 55


#. Click on the :guilabel:`Add layerâ€¦` button.
#. Within the Add layer window, click on the :guilabel:`Add` button.
#. Select the ``HYP_50M_SR_W.tif`` layer.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Open` button to return to the Add layer window.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Ok` button and close the Configure locator window.

Finish the installation
-----------------------

#. Click on *Start downloading*.
