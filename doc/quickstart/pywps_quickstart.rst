@NAME_pywps@ Quickstart
********************************

PyWPS is an OGC WPS (Web Processing Service 1.0.0) server implementation written
in `Python <http://python.org>`_.

The PyWPS 4.0.0 library is installed by default on OSGeo-Live. This is a core 
library that is not intended to be executed directly, but rather to be used in the
development of WPS services. An `example service <https://github.com/geopython/pywps-flask>`_ 
based on `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ is available at
GitHub to facilitate a first contact with PyWPS. 

This Quickstart describes how to:

* Install and configure the pywps-flask example service
* Perform ``GetCapabilities``, ``DescribeProcess`` and ``Execute`` requests
* Develop your own WPS processes
* Next steps

Installing pywps-flask
======================

Since the example service depends on Flask, make sure it is installed on your 
OSGeo-Live:

`sudo apt install python-flask`

Then clone the repository from GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/geopython/pywps-flask.git`

Now move into the repository folder and edit the configuration file. This can 
be done with a program like `nano`:

`nano pywps.cfg`

The only critical thing to verify is the location of logging database. 
`Pywps-flask` provides a sample SQLite database that can be used for this 
purpose. Make sure the `database` setting reads like:

`database=sqlite:////home/user/pywps-flask/logs/pywps-logs.sqlite3`  

Save the configuration file and exit `nano` you can now run the service:

`python demo.py`

If all goes well you will receive back a message like:

`* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`
     
Testing available processes
===========================

Open your favourite web browser and point it to the address where the example 
service is listening: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/ <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>`_ You will
be presented with the following page:

.. image:: /images/projects/pywps/pywps-4.0.0_example.png
  :scale: 100 %
  
Use the green buttons to explore the service. Issue a `GetCapabilities` request
for an overview of the service; issue a `DescribeProcess` request to learn the
details of a particular project. Note the request URL in the browser address.

It is now time to test an `Execute` request. You can try the `say_hello` 
process, which is fairly simple. Direct your web browser to the following 
address:

`http://localhost:5000/wps?service=WPS&version=1.0.0&request=Execute&identifier=say_hello&dataInputs=name=OSGeo-Live`

The process simply replies back with a "Hello OSGeo" message, encoded in a 
standard WPS response document. Your browser should be showing something like:

  :scale: 100 %

Developing WPS processes
========================

To develop new processes all you need to do is create new Python modules 
inside the `processes` folder. Use the existing processes as templates to help
you structure your code. A closer look at the `say_hello` process shows the
main feature of a PyWPS process:

1. Import the necessary assets and create a class inheriting from the PyWPS 
`Process` class. In the constructor create the necessary objects for inputs
and outputs:

.. code::

	from pywps import Process, LiteralInput, LiteralOutput, UOM
	
	class SayHello(Process):
	    def __init__(self):
	        inputs = [LiteralInput('name', 'Input name', data_type='string')]
	        outputs = [LiteralOutput('response',
	                                 'Output response', data_type='string')]


2. Invoke the parent constructor, passing on the metadata of the process:

.. code::

        super(SayHello, self).__init__(
            self._handler,
            identifier='say_hello',
            title='Process Say Hello',
            abstract='Returns a literal string output\
             with Hello plus the inputed name',
            version='1.3.3.7',
            inputs=inputs,
            outputs=outputs,
            store_supported=True,
            status_supported=True
        )

3. Create the `handler` method, that will be invoked to handle `Execute` 
requests. Use the `request` and `response` objects to retrieve inputs and set
outputs.

.. code::

    def _handler(self, request, response):
        response.outputs['response'].data = 'Hello ' + \
            request.inputs['name'][0].data
        response.outputs['response'].uom = UOM('unity')
        return response

What's Next
===========

PyWPS gives you the freedom and flexibility to write your own Python processes and expose them
accordingly.

  to PyWPS 4.
  
Deployment to production
------------------------

  The `pywps-flask` service is just an example and not designed for production. 
  One possible alternative is a Django based service, `pywps-django <https://github.com/jorgejesus/pywps-django>`_. The 
  documentation provides further details on how to `set up a production service <http://pywps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment.html>`_
  with `Apache <https://httpd.apache.org/>`_ or `nginx <https://nginx.org/>`_ and `Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org/>`_.
