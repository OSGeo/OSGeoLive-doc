The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share
documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory
text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation,
statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.


This Quick Start describes how to:

  * Start a Jupyter Notebook server
  * Load a jupyter notebook
  * Interact with python code

.. contents:: Contents

Start the Jupyter server
================================================================================

From the application launch menu in the lower left corner.

* Choose *Geospatial* -> *Spatial Tools* -> *Jupyter Notebook*

A terminal window will open and a startup log will begin to scroll. Afterwards a
web browser is launched showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.
From the Jupyter Notebook dashboard you can navigate the directory tree, start
new notebooks, create files and directories, as well as rename, delete and
upload files.

Open and execute an existing notebook
================================================================================

Let's open an existing notebook. From the main page click on the directory
geopandas-tutorial and choose the Introduction notebook
(01-introduction-geospatial-data.ipynb).
This is an introduction with many examples on how to use geospatial vector data
in Python with geopandas using the Natural Earth2 data.

The tutorial is made up with explaining text and cells. The cells contain in
this case python code, that can be run.

From the toolbar on top of the notebook you can choose different options:

* Cell-> Run Cells: will run the code in the cell with the focus and will move
  to the next cell.
* Cell-> Run All: will run all the cells and show the results If everything
  worked as planned you should be able to see the results at the bottom of the
  page.

Have a look at the results after running all the cells.

You will see additional Out[] section with different output for example tables,
maps or calculations.

In Out[3] you can see the country information as a table.

In Out[4] a plot was generated from all the countries.

Change code
================================================================================

Now let's change some of the code.


In In [10] a filter was defined for the countries. Only the continent ``Africa``
is selected from the countries:

.. code-block:: python

    In [10]:  africa = countries[countries['continent'] == 'Africa']

Therefore in the plot there is only the continent ``Africa``.

.. image:: /images/projects/jupyter/jupyter3-1.png
   :scale: 80 %

Change the selection to ``Asia`` and rund the two cells again.

.. code-block:: python

    In [10]:  africa = countries[countries['continent'] == 'Asia']

As result you will see that instead of ``Africa`` there will be ``Asia`` in the plot.
