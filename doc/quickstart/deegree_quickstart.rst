@NAME_deegree@ Quickstart
********************************************************************************

*deegree* is open source software for spatial data infrastructures and the
geospatial web. *deegree* is a Java application for serving maps (and vector
data) for other clients to visualize.

Available components are:

* Web services: WFS, WMS, WMTS, CSW, WPS

*deegree 3.6.0-pre2* is the newest pre-release version of the deegree Java
framework for GIS applications and OGC-service implementations.  It can be used
to build web-based geospatial-data-infrastructures (GDI).

Start deegree webservices
===============================================================================

Choose |menu_deegree-Start|.
The application will take a few moments to start up.

Firefox opens the *deegree webservices administration console*. Alternatively,
you can also open this manually by pointing your browser to
http://localhost:8080/deegree.
The administration console is a simple web-based GUI for editing the
configuration files of the activated *deegree workspace*.

Load a workspace
===============================================================================

*deegree* uses configurations conformant to all *deegree* based webservices.
Those configurations are stored in the workspace.

#. To manage the included and ready-to-use workspaces, click *'workspaces'* on
   the left side. You are now in the workspace management of the running
   *deegree* instance.
   You can see which workspace is currently active (only one can be active at a
   time) workspace, inactive locally available workspaces and official
   workspaces which can be imported if you have a internet connection.
#. Press start on the *deegree-workspace-utah-light* workspace.

  * The demo workspace contains a web mapping setup based on data from the state
    of Utah. It contains a WMS configuration (1.3.0 and 1.1.1) consisting of
    vector layers and a variety of render styles. Additionally, a WFS (2.0.0,
    1.1.0 and 1.0.0) is configured that allows to access the raw vector data,
    backed by shapefiles, in GML format.

**Tip:**
For additional configuration examples including raster data, you can import the
workspace *deegree-workspace-utah* through the workspace management (internet
connection is required).

Visualize the data
================================================================================

#. Click on *'web services'* to display all the preconfigured web services (WFS
   and WMS).

#. Click on the *'Capabilities'* button of the preconfigured WMS. The
   GetCapabilities document of the WMS will open in a new tab.

#. Use the GetCapabilities request URL to add the WMS to for example :doc:`QGIS
   <../overview/qgis_overview>`. Once added, you can choose of a variety of layers served by
   the deegree WMS here.
