@NAME_deegree@ Quickstart
********************************************************************************

*deegree* is open source software for spatial data infrastructures and the
geospatial web. *deegree* is a Java application for serving maps (and vector data) for other clients to show.

Available components are:

  * Web-Services: WFS, WMS, WMTS, CSW, WPS

*deegree 3* is the new generation of the deegree Java framework for GIS
applications and OGC-service implementations.
It can be used to build web-based geospatial-data-infrastructures (GDI).

Start deegree 3 webservices
===========================

Choose |menu_deegree-Start|.
The application will take a few moments to start up.

Firefox opens the *deegree 3 services console*. (You can also open this manually by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8033).
This is a simple web-based GUI for editing the configuration files of the *deegree workspace*.

Load a workspace
================

*deegree 3* uses configurations conformant to all *deegree 3* based webservices. Those configurations are stored in the workspace.

#. To manage the included and ready-to-use workspaces, click *'workspaces'* on the left side. You are now in the workspace management of the running *deegree* instance.
   You can see which workspace is currently active (only one can be active at a time) workspace, inactive locally available workspaces and offical workspaces which can be imported if you have a internet connection.
#. Press start on the *deegree-workspace-utah-light*.

The demo workspace contains a web mapping setup based on data from the state of Utah.
It contains a WMS configuration (1.3.0 and 1.1.1) consisting of vector layers and a variety of render styles.
Additionally, a WFS (2.0.0, 1.1.0 and 1.0.0) is configured that allows to access the raw vector data, backed by shapefiles, in GML format.

.. tip::
   For additional configuration examples including raster data,
   you can import the workspace *deegree-workspace-utah* through the workspace management (internet connection is required).

View a map
==========

#. Click on *'see layers'* to open a simple map-client. The service is configured to visualize the data and a basemap (rendered by `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_).

#. Click on the **+** on the right side to open a layer tree showing all available layers. You can activate the a variety of layers served by the deegree WMS here.

.. tip::
   The map client is based on `OpenLayers <https://openlayers.org/>`_.
   You can pan through the map holding the left mouse button and drag the map.
   Zooming is possible via mouse wheel or the navigation elements on the left side.
