OpenCPN is a concise Chart Plotter and Navigator (CPN). As always, never
use a piece of software or electronic equipment as your only means of
navigation and keep an eye out the window.

Setting up your charts
======================

Before running OpenCPN on the LiveDVD you should activate the sample data.
This is a condition of redistributing NOAA's free nautical charts. The first time you open OpenCPN you are presented with the option to do this automatically.

#. From the Start menu, select :menuselection:`Geospatial --> Navigation and Maps --> OpenCPN`.
#. Click :guilabel:`I agree` to the NOAA Nautical Chart Data Agreement.
#. Click :guilabel:`OK` to agree to the OpenCPN license.

.. To do this manually, open a Terminal from the main Accessories menu and run :command:`opencpn_noaa_agreement.sh` at the command prompt. The user's password is given in the file on the main desktop.

You can download additional US nautical charts from NOAA at https://www.charts.noaa.gov/


Setting up your GPS
===================

If you have a GPS connected you will want to start the gpsd service.
To do that, open a terminal and run:

::

  sudo dpkg-reconfigure gpsd

and

::

  sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd start

BlueTooth GPS users should take special care to read up about the no-probe
option.

.. no longer true? : (for this reason we have not started gpsd automatically)


.. Tip:: '`xgps`' is a good program to check that Gpsd can see your GPS ok.


Things to try
=============

Current weather and wave forecast data can be downloaded and draped over your charts using the GRIB plugin. The :doc:`zyGrib software <../overview/zygrib_overview>` (also on this disc) is an easy way to download that. 

#. Click the :guilabel:`Options` icon on the toolbar. The Options window displays.
#. Select the :guilabel:`Plugins` tab.
#. Choose GRIB and then click :guilabel:`Enable`.
#. Click :guilabel:`OK`. A windsock icon is now displayed on the toolbar.


Run through the :doc:`zyGrib quickstart <../quickstart/zygrib_quickstart>` and load the zyGrib file over your chart.

.. Note:: If you saved the zyGrib file into your home directory, navigate to :file:`/home` and select your ``user`` directory as the GRIB data directory. Then right click on the file listing's background to show hidden files, including the ``.zygrib`` directory that contains the GRIB download files.

  There is no need to uncompress the file.  Click on the ">" to the left of the filename and select from the list of available forecast times.
