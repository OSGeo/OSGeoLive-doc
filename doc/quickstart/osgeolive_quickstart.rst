Getting started with OSGeoLive
********************************************************************************

This Quick Start describes how to start OSGeoLive from a DVD or USB.

System Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your computer should have at least:

* RAM: minimum 2 GB (4 GB recommended).
* CPU: 1 GHz 64 bit.
* Hard Disk: 

 * None required if running directly from the DVD 
 * |osgeolive-hdspace| if you wish to install the operating system. 

* Mouse: a 3-button mouse is useful, especially for Mac trackpad users. 

Run:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Source an OSGeoLive DVD, ISO available from: [:doc:`Download <../download>`]
  Put the DVD into your computer's CD drive, then reboot your computer.

  If your computer is set to boot from CD (as is often the case) you should
  boot up into a Lubuntu system, with Geospatial applications installed.
  Otherwise you'll have to adjust the BIOS boot settings or press the boot
  menu button just after powering-up.
