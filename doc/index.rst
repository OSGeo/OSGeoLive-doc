`OSGeoLive <https://live.osgeo.org>`_ is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB
thumb drive or Virtual Machine based on `Lubuntu <https://lubuntu.net>`_,
that allows you to try a wide variety of open
source geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed
entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated
and passed around.
