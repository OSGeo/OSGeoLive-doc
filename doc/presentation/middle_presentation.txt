.. revealjs:: Desktop GIS
    .. rv_note::
        Let's now look at the applications installed on OSGeoLive, starting with the Desktop GIS applications.
        This is where we find the heavy lifting applications.
        These applications cover the traditional GIS uses cases of viewing,
        editing and analysing geospatial data.

.. revealjs:: Browser Facing GIS
    .. rv_note::
        We will now look at browser-based clients.
        Browser clients are regularly used to publish maps,
        and are increasingly being used to deliver a wide range of tools
        and functions previously only available in desktop applications.

.. revealjs:: Web Services
    .. rv_note::
        We'll now look at Web Services.
        Web Services are accessed via a URL,
        and return map data in various formats.
        Data is primarily accessed via OGC standards-based interfaces,
        including Web Map Services for images,
        Web Feature Services for vector data and Catalog Services for the Web for Metadata.

.. revealjs:: Data Stores
    .. rv_note::
        At the bottom of the stack are the databases.

.. revealjs:: Navigation and Maps
    .. rv_note::
        The next category we will look at is Navigation and Maps.

.. revealjs:: Spatial Tools
    .. rv_note::
        The next category we have grouped together are Spatial Tools.

.. revealjs:: Domain Specific GIS
    .. rv_note::
        In this section, we have grouped applications targeted at a specific domain.

.. revealjs:: Data
    .. rv_note::
        Of course, all these free tools become much more useful with access to free mapping data.

.. revealjs:: Geospatial Libraries
    .. rv_note::
        We will now look at key libraries which have shown a level of quality by going through the OSGeo Incubation process.
