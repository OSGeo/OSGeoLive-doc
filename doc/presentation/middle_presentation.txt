.. revealjs:: Desktop GIS
    .. rv_note::
        Let's start by reviewing Desktop GIS applications,
        where we find the heavy lifting applications.
        These applications cover the traditional GIS uses cases of viewing,
        editing and analysing geospatial data.

.. revealjs:: Browser Facing GIS
    .. rv_note::
        We will now look at browser-based clients.
        Browser clients are regularly used to publish maps,
        and increasingly being used to deliver a wide range of tools
        and functions previously only available in desktop applications.

.. revealjs:: Web Services
    .. rv_note::
        We'll now look at Web Services.
        Web Services are accessed via a URL,
        and return map data in various formats.
        Data is primarily accessed via OGC standards-based interfaces,
        including Web Map Services for images,
        Web Feature Services for vector data and Catalog Services for the Web for Metadata.

.. revealjs:: Data Stores
    .. rv_note::
        At the bottom of the stack are the databases.

.. revealjs:: Navigation and Maps
    .. rv_note::
        The next category we will look at is Navigation and Maps.

.. revealjs:: Spatial Tools
    .. rv_note::
        The next category we have grouped together are Spatial Tools.

.. revealjs:: Domain Specific GIS
    .. rv_note::
        In this section, we have grouped applications targeted at a specific domain.

.. revealjs:: Data
    .. rv_note::
        Of course, all these free tools become much more useful with access to free mapping data.

.. revealjs:: Geospatial Libraries
    .. rv_note::
        We will now look at key libraries which have shown a level of quality by going through the OSGeo Incubation process.
