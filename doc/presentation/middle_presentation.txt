.. revealjs:: Desktop GIS
.. speaker notes:
   Let's start by reviewing Desktop GIS applications, where we find the heavy
   lifting applications.  These applications cover the traditional GIS uses
   cases of viewing, editing and analysing geospatial data.

.. revealjs:: Browser Facing GIS
.. speaker notes:
   We will now look at browser-based clients.  Browser clients are regularly
   used to publish maps, and increasingly being used to deliver a wide range of
   tools and functions previously only available in desktop applications.

.. revealjs:: Web Services
.. speaker notes:
   We'll now look at Web Services.  Web Services are accessed via a URL, and
   return map data in various formats.  Data is primarily accessed via OGC
   standards-based interfaces, including Web Map Services for images, Web
   Feature Services for vector data and Catalog Services for the Web for
   Metadata.

.. revealjs:: Data Stores
.. speaker notes:
   At the bottom of the stack are the databases.

.. revealjs:: Navigation and Maps
.. speaker notes:
   The next category we will look at is Navigation and Maps.

.. revealjs:: Spatial Tools
.. speaker notes:
   The next category we have grouped together are Spatial Tools.

.. revealjs:: Domain Specific GIS
.. speaker notes:
   In this section, we have grouped applications targeted at a specific domain.

.. revealjs:: Data
.. speaker notes:
   Of course, all these free tools become much more useful with access to free
   mapping data.

.. revealjs:: Geospatial Libraries
.. speaker notes:
   We will now look at key libraries which have shown a level of quality by
   going through the OSGeo Incubation process.
