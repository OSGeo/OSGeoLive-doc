        .. rv_note::
            Let's start by reviewing Desktop GIS applications,
            where we find the heavy lifting applications.
            These applications cover the traditional GIS uses cases of viewing,
            editing and analysing geospatial data.
    

    .. revealjs:: QGIS
        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/qgis/qgis_screenshot.png
            :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            Quantum GIS, or QGIS, is a very popular user-friendly GIS client which allows you to visualize, manage, edit, analyse data, and compose printable maps. It supports numerous vector, raster and database formats, and boasts many free toolboxes, including a user-friendly interface to many of the advanced GRASS analysis modules.
        




    .. revealjs:: GRASS GIS
        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/grass/grass_screenshot.png
            :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            GRASS GIS provides powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing. It includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.
            It includes over 400 built-in analysis modules and 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes.
            With over 30 years of continuous development, GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available. It is capable of very powerful analysis, but may not be as simple to get started with as other offerings with more of a geodata viewer focus. Many Open Source projects make use of GRASS's algorithms.




    .. revealjs:: gvSIG Desktop
        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/gvsig/gvsig_screenshot.png
            :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            In 2003, the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure in Valencia, Spain, started migrating all their systems to Open Source Software. Part of this migration involved the development of gvSIG to replace ESRI desktop applications in use.
            gvSIG is a desktop GIS application designed for capturing, storing, handling, analysing and deploying any kind of referenced geographic information in order to solve complex management and planning problems.
            gvSIG is available in over 20 languages, and has a very strong following amongst Spanish speakers.

        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/openjump/openjump_screenshot.png
            :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            OpenJUMP is a spin-off from the original JUMP project, which was Open Source but didn't accept improvements and updates from the community. This resulted in over 10 forks of the original code base. OpenJUMP provided a merging back together of many of these forks.
            OpenJUMP is an easy to use and powerful deskstop GIS that enables users to edit, analyse, and display geographic data. It is particularly good at conflation, which involves aligning a feature which is shown in different locations on two different map layers.
        




    .. revealjs:: SAGA
        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/saga/saga_screenshot.png
            :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Note 
            SAGA, or the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses, is a GIS used for editing and analysing spatial data. It includes a large number of modules for the analysis of vector, table, grid and image data.

        .. rv_note::
            We will now look at browser-based clients.
            Browser clients are regularly used to publish maps,
            and increasingly being used to deliver a wide range of tools
            and functions previously only available in desktop applications.
    

    .. revealjs:: OpenLayers
        :title-heading: h3
  
        .. image:: ../images/projects/openlayers/openlayers_screenshot.png

        .. rv_note::
            We'll now look at Web Services.
            Web Services are accessed via a URL,
            and return map data in various formats.
            Data is primarily accessed via OGC standards-based interfaces,
            including Web Map Services for images,
            Web Feature Services for vector data and Catalog Services for the Web for Metadata.
