                     <p>OSGeoLive is a self-contained bootable DVD, based on the Lubuntu Linux distribution, that is pre-installed and pre-configured with over 50 of the best GeoSpatial Open Source applications along with sample datasets.</p>
                     <p>It contains overview and quickstart documentation for each application, as well as documentation about key OGC spatial standards.</p>
                     <p>The DVD is ideal for handing out at conferences, using in workshops, and trialling a range of Open Source Software.</p>

                     <p>OSGeoLive helps new users quickly find quality GIS applications from the myriads of options. OSGeoLive only accepts established open source projects, and users can then verify the application works by running it on OSGeoLive. This slide shows the OpenHUB metrics page, which shows the community size and activity.</p>

                     <p>OSGeoLive provides a production and marketing pipeline, providing value to a whole range of user groups.</p>
                     <p>Developers who package and support testing of their applications on OSGeoLive get their applications marketed at conferences, workshops and on the web.</p>
                     <p>Document writers get their documentation reviewed, translated into multiple languages and published.</p>
                     <p>Translators are provided with quality source documentation, and a publish through OSGeo web pages.</p>
                     <p>Conference organisers welcome presentations which explain the breadth of Geospatial Open Source, often having a VIP present a derivative of the OSGeoLive during keynote presentations, and adding value to delegates by giving away an OSGeoLive DVD or USB.</p>
                     <p>Geospatial educators and workshop presenters use the stable OGeo-Live Virtual Machine or USB for practical class room settings.</p>
                     <p>Which all leads to Architects and Developers discovering, and then incorporating Open Source Geospatial software in their projects.</p>

It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.</p>

                     <p>OpenJUMP is a spin-off from the original JUMP project, which was Open Source but didn't accept improvements and updates from the community. This resulted in over 10 forks of the original code base. OpenJUMP provided a merging back together of many of these forks. </p>
                     <p>OpenJUMP is an easy to use and powerful deskstop GIS that enables users to edit, analyse, and display geographic data. It is particularly good at conflation, which involves aligning a feature which is shown in different locations on two different map layers.</p>
