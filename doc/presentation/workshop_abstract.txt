:Workshop Title: Introduction to the breadth of Geospatial Open Source

:Description:

This workshop is designed to provide a hands on introduction to the breadth of quality geospatial open source applications, which are available for the full range of geospatial use cases, including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation of data.

The workshop is based on OSGeoLive, which is a self-contained DVD, USB thumb drive and Virtual Machine, based on Lubuntu linux.  It includes over 50 of the best geospatial, open source applications, pre-configured with data, project overviews and quick-starts, translated into multiple languages. It is an excellent tool for demonstrating GeoSpatial Open Source, using in tutorials and workshops, or providing to potential new users.

The workshop covers:
* Getting set up with OSGeoLive, either from a USB, or from a pre-installed virtual machine.
* Introduction to the use of the Linux windows environment. 
* Introduction to the key OGC spatial standards and common stack of software used by Open Source spatial systems.
* An overview of the categories of applications installed on OSGeoLive.
* A hands on walk-though of the quickstarts for key popular applications within each category, including:
** The Postgres/PostGIS spatial database
** GeoServer for publishing maps to the internet
** OpenLayers for creating browser based mapping applications
** QGIS for analysing maps on the desktop

This presentation is very useful for anyone wishing to gain a high level understanding of the breadth of geospatial open source available.
