    .. revealjs:: Components on OSGeoLive

        * 50+ Open Source Geospatial Applications.
        * Sample Datasets.
        * Consistent Overviews & Quickstarts.
        * Translations.


        .. rv_note::
            OSGeoLive is a self-contained bootable USB, based on the Lubuntu Linux distribution, that is pre-installed and pre-configured with over 50 of the best GeoSpatial Open Source applications along with sample datasets.
            It contains overview and quickstart documentation for each application, as well as documentation about key OGC spatial standards.
            The USB is ideal for handing out at conferences, using in workshops, and trialling a range of Open Source Software.

    .. revealjs:: DVD / USB / Virtual Machine

            :height: 400

        .. rv_note::
            OSGeoLive can be run from a DVD, USB flash drive, installed into a Virtual Machine, or installed onto your hard drive.
            This presentation provides a lightning overview of all applications installed on OSGeoLive, which effectively gives you a birds eye view of the breadth of robust GeoSpatial Open Source Software available.

    .. revealjs:: Quality Criteria

        * Established, stable, working software
        * Active community
        * `Metrics <https://live.osgeo.org/en/metrics.html>`__

        .. image:: ../images/presentation/metrics.png
            :height: 400

        .. rv_note::
            OSGeoLive helps new users quickly find quality GIS applications from the myriads of options.
            OSGeoLive only accepts established open source projects, and users can then verify the application works by running it on OSGeoLive.
            This slide shows the OpenHUB metrics page, which shows the community size and activity.

    .. revealjs:: Production & Marketing Pipeline

        .. image:: ../images/presentation/pipeline.png
            :height: 400

        .. rv_note::
            * OSGeoLive provides a production and marketing pipeline, providing value to a whole range of user groups.
            * Developers who package and support testing of their applications on OSGeoLive get their applications marketed at conferences, workshops and on the web.
            * Document writers get their documentation reviewed, translated into multiple languages and published.
            * Translators are provided with quality source documentation, and a publish through OSGeo web pages.
            * Conference organisers welcome presentations which explain the breadth of Geospatial Open Source, often having a VIP present a derivative of the OSGeoLive during keynote presentations, and adding value to delegates by giving away an OSGeoLive DVD or USB.
            * Geospatial educators and workshop presenters use the stable OGeo-Live Virtual Machine or USB for practical class room settings.
            * Which all leads to Architects and Developers discovering, and then incorporating Open Source Geospatial software in their projects.


    .. revealjs:: What is new in 12.0</h2>

        * Updated to Lubuntu 18.04 LTS
        * Updated core packages based on DebianGIS
        * Major documentation updates
        * Translations done on Transifex
        * Automated doc building
        * Embraced OSGeo re-branding
        * Added (geo)datascience packages
        * Full `changelog <href="https://github.com/OSGeo/OSGeoLive/blob/master/CHANGES.txt">`__

        .. rv_note::
            In OSGeoLive Version 12.0 we've improved our documentation and translation process, making it easier to maintain. We've also updated many existing applications and moved to the latest Lubuntu 18.04 Long Term Support release.

        .. rv_note::
            Set up in 2006, the OSGeo Foundation is non-profit for the geospatial community which fosters an open approach to software, standards, education, research and data.
            It supports with advocacy, events, organisation and legal matters.
            OSGeoLive derives its name from the Open Source GeoSpatial Foundation, or OSGeo for short.

        Non Profit for geospatial community, fostering:

        * Free and Open Source Software
        * Open Standards
        * Open Education
        * Open Research

        .. rv_note::
            * Open Source applications have a reputation for excellent standards compliance. Notably, the OGC uses Open Source projects when defining reference implementations for standards.
            * Standards supported by included projects are listed in the Project Overviews.
            * Building Spatial Data Infrastructures using standards, facilitates interoperability between proprietary and open source applications.
            * It facilitates sharing data between agencies.
            * It reduces long term costs associated with data maintenance,
            * and it reduces long term project risk by avoiding dependence upon proprietary formats or products, thus avoiding vendor lock-in.
