        .. rv_note::
            OSGeoLive is a Linux distribution, that is pre-installed with over 50 GeoSpatial Open Source applications along with sample datasets, overviews and quickstarts.
            It is used for training, trailing new applications, and outreach.
            In this presentation we introduce the more popular packages, which effectively compresses a FOSS4G conference into a concise elevator pitch.

    .. revealjs:: Quality Criteria

        .. rv_note::
            Our focus with OSGeoLive is identifying and promoting robust and sustainable projects.
            Our metrics page provides project dashboards from OpenHub. Use it to gain insights into each projects health and developer engagement.

    .. revealjs:: Production & Marketing Pipeline

        .. rv_note::
            * OSGeoLive provides a production and marketing pipeline, providing value to a diverse user group.
            * Developers get their applications marketed at conferences, workshops and on the web.
            * Educators have a stable plaform to run workshops from.
            * Document writers get their documentation reviewed, translated into multiple languages.
            * Translators are provided with quality source documentation.
            * Conference organisers have a relevant OSGeoLive USB to hand out at conferences.
            * Which all leads to Architects and Developers quickly finding the best Open Geospatial applications.


    .. revealjs:: What is new in 12.0</h2>

        * Package updates
        * Updated to Lubuntu 18.04 LTS
        * Documentation process updates
        * Translations moved to Transifex

        .. rv_note::
            In OSGeoLive 12.0 we've improved our documentation and translation process, making it easier to maintain. We've also updated many existing applications and moved to the latest Lubuntu 18.04 Long Term Support release.

        .. rv_note::
            OSGeoLive derives its name from the Open Source GeoSpatial Foundation, or OSGeo for short.
            The OSGeo Foundation is a non-profit for the geospatial community which fosters an open approach to software, standards, education, research and data.

    .. revealjs:: OGC Standards

        .. rv_note::
            * Open Source applications have a reputation for excellent standards compliance. Notably, the OGC uses Open Source projects when defining reference implementations for standards.
            * Standards supported are listed in the Project Overviews.
            * Building Spatial Data Infrastructures using standards, facilitates interoperability between proprietary and open source applications.
            * It facilitates sharing data between agencies.
            * It reduces long term costs associated with data maintenance,
            * and it reduces long term project risk by avoiding dependence upon proprietary formats or products, thus avoiding vendor lock-in.
