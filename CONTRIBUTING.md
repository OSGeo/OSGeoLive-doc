## Pull Request Process

2. If necessary, sign the **contributor licensing agreement**
3. For big changes fill, eventually engage discussion in a new issue or in the mailing list.
4. Make the PR

### Evaluate the change

In the OSGeoLive, we see two types of contribution.

#### What qualifies as an OBVIOUS FIX?
An obvious fix is a pull request that does not contain creative work. We rely on your judgment to determine what is “obvious”; if you’re not sure, just ask by sending an email to the [OSGeoLive mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/osgeolive).

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

* Spelling/grammar fixes;
* Correcting typos;
* Cleaning up comments in the code;
* Changes to white space or formatting;
* Adding logging messages or debugging output;
* Changes to files like  Makefile, .gitignore, example configuration files, build scripts, etc.;
* Changes that reflect outside facts, like renaming a build directory or changing a constant;
* Changes in build or installation scripts;
* Re-ordering of objects or subroutines within a source file (such as alphabetizing routines);
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another, with no changes in code;
* Breaking a source file into multiple source files, or consolidating multiple source files into one source file, with no change in code behavior;
* Changes to words or phrases isolated from their context;
* Changes to typeface.

#### Things that would still require signing a CLA before submitting would likely include stuff like the following:

* Any of the above actions that result in a change in functionality;
* Adding a new project;
* Adding a new file (Overview, Quickstart);
* Joining a translation team;
* Requesting a new language;
* A new feature in the installation files;
* Extensive or creative comments.

### CLA
A contributor licensing agreement (CLA) must be filled out by every contributor to OSGeoLive.

The CLA makes everyone’s rights clear:

You (or your company) grant copyright license for your contributions to OSGeoLive.
You (or your company) grant patent license for your contributions to OSGeoLive.
The contribution is entirely voluntary.
The work is your original creation.
You (or your company) are not required to provide support for your contributions.
You (or your company) should read and understand the entire CLA before signing it. Our description of it is not legally binding.

Please send your CLA to the [OSGeoLive mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/osgeolive).

#### OSGeoLive CLA example

"I want to contribute XXX to OSGeoLive. I acknowledge that my contributions will be in line with OSGeoLive's Open licenses and OSGeo Code of Conduct."

### How does the OBVIOUS FIX RULE work?

Any committer may commit fixes without first signing a CLA for obvious typos, grammar mistakes, and formatting problems wherever they may be.

Whenever you invoke the Obvious Fix Rule, please say so in your commit message. For example:

> commit 375t3248vkdd912b0cf9c1d1e99b13
  Author: javier <javi@carto.com>
  Date: Tue Jul 24 12:15:03 2013 -0500
  Fix typo in install file docs.
  Obvious fix.

Contributors to OSGeoLive are expected to act respectfully toward others in accordance with the [OSGeo Code of Conduct](https://www.osgeo.org/code_of_conduct/).

By submitting content to this project, you agree to be bound by the OSGeo contributor agreement [OSGeo Code of Conduct](https://www.osgeo.org/code_of_conduct/). 

Please read carefully the [OSGeo Code of Conduct](https://www.osgeo.org/code_of_conduct/) and

### Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone behaving inappropriately with respect to a code of conduct, you may reply to them, and point to this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. Assume good faith; it is more likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour than that they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion. Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your concerns to event staff, a forum leader or any OSGeo Board member or officer. Serious or persistent offenders may be expelled from the event or forum by event organizers or forum leaders.

You can contact any [OSGeoLive PSC member](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeoLive_PSC) or privately email the code of conduct committee leadership using this mail adress : coc@osgeo.org.
